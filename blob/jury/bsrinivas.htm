<div style="text-align: justify">
	<p class="text-justify">Mr. Srinivas Bhajanehatti, is fondly referred to as "Dhronacharya" of Wildlife Photographers in Bangalore. He had
	guided and helped many amateur photographers participate in Salons and win International Distinctions. He was one of the best
	experts in printing and provided printing services to all the leading photographers of his time. His printing skill in Black 
	and White as well as in Color has helped nearly 32 photographers in achieving 48 various international distinctions. His interest in wildlife and
	photography started during his high school days in 1976. His father, a professional photographer himself, was his first Guru. Later on
	when he started learning from Shri. C Rajagopal, his photography and printing skills soared to new heights. Under his guidance
	and encouragement, shri B Srinivas participated in many salons and won innumerable awards. He achieved his international
	distinctions from RPS and FIAP at a young age of 35, possibly among the youngest to achieve this honor.

	<p class="text-justify">He has to his credit more than 550 acceptances, 50 awards and 46 certificates in National Salons and 196 
	acceptances, 23 Honorable Mentions, 18 awards in International Salons. He has been a judge for FIAP distinctions continuously 
	from 1990. He was also on the panel of jury of many National and International Salons. 
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">He was part of the team of jury in many Salons, notably the World Cup held in Bangalore in 2014. As 
	photography moved from films and prints to digital, he too moved to the digital world quite late in his carer. At 65, his passion 
	for photography is still burning bright.
