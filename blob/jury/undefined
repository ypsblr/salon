<p class="text-justify">Sara Gabri&euml;ls bought her first DSLR in 2016 and immediately enrolled in an entry-level photography course, the start of an amazing adventure. By the end of 2017, she decided to try her luck in the international photography competitions. She wanted to find out if she had a place in the amateur photography world.</p>
<p class="text-justify">In six years she won many &ndash; national as well as international &ndash; titles, medals, awards, trophies and several blue badges. One of the highlights happened in 2021 when she earned the title of Belgium Champion Photography.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Sara&rsquo;s first love is night photography. However today she equally finds pleasure in portrait photography, street photography and macro as well. She is self-driven and doesn&rsquo;t rest once she sets her mind to it. Sara operates from the heart.</p>
