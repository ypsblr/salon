	<p>Hailing from a small village in the heart of Western Ghats in Karnataka, my mind and soul was always close to beautiful flora and 
		fauna of Mother Nature. But I was able to capture its essence only from few years back when I got my first camera. Photographing 
		insect world  and Landscapes gives me more satisfaction than any other subject.

	<p>Employed now with an IT major, I make it a point to travel all over India in search of natural beauty, whenever time permits. As 
		for my family, I live in Bangalore with my wife and 5 year old son. My parents are back at my village near Sirsi.
