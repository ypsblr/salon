</p>
<p>Mr. Pandula Bandara hails from Delgoda in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. At the age of 45, he applied himself to develop his passion for photography as a stress-release from running of a successful business. He followed a course run by The Photographic Society of Sri Lanka (PSSL) which gave him a sound base from which to develop his knowledge of photography. He is fascinated by all fields of photography and is a firm believer in the old saying that practice makes perfect! To this end, he participated in as many photography field trips, workshops and studio shoots as he could in order to perfect his skills.</p>
