	<p>Arjun Haarith has his interest in photography raised in early ages. He had been going out regularly with H Satish (Renowned Wildlife Photographer 
		and President of YPS) and has developed keen skills in photography in the process. While he started as a Nature photographer, he found his rhythm 
		in travel photography that goes with his keen interest to see places and also document the trips in well written blogs. His Blog 
		site <a href="http://arjunhaarith.blogspot.in/" target="_blank">http://arjunhaarith.blogspot.in/</a> has over 40 blogs containing excellent 
		descriptions of the place, hints on stay, places to see and very well made travel photographs. He has visited many Himalayan sojourns in Nepal 
		and India including his recent trip to Spiti Valley and his earlier trips to Kumaon, Garhwal, Roopkund, Great Himalayan National Park and many more.
