<p>Jef Lemmens, a passionate photographer from Belgium, purchased his first camera almost half a century ago. Though his interest in photography ebbed and flowed over the years, it eventually blossomed into a true passion. In fact, about 15 years ago, Jef joined a local photography club and his love for the art has only continued to grow. Over time, Jef's skills and dedication to photography earned him recognition in both national and international competitions. He has been honored with the distinctions of HonFIAP, EFIAP/d3, and GMPSA/b. Jef has also been asked to judge dozens of regional, national, and international photo contests, as well as serve as the chairman of such contests at each level. Jef's commitment to photography extends beyond his own work and the contests he participates in. He is a vice-president of his own photo club, "Fotogroep Pallieter Lier," and also serves as a board member for a regional federation with approximately 70 affiliated photo clubs. Furthermore, Jef is the director of the FIAP Collection service and FIAP Distinctions service.</p>
