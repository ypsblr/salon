	<p>Mohan Thomas is a civil engineer by profession and the Managing Partner of Canaan Group which is involved in construction work. 
		Photography has been his passion ever since his college days though this passion had to be temporarily kept in abeyance owing 
		to the exigencies of work in his early years. But having put those years behind him, he soon picked up the camera again. 
		By now he had become an avid nature lover and before long he began photographing wildlife and nature. This newfound activity 
		soon developed into a serious hobby taking him past the jungles of India to many other parts of the world as well such as Africa, 
		Norway, Finland, South America and Russia. At present he can be spotted at various reserves doing what he loves best. His love, 
		dedication and passion for wildlife are conveyed through each image captured. He also takes an active part in wildlife 
		conservation projects in the hopes of protecting the Indian jungles for the future generations.
