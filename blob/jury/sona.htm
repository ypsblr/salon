<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In her words... &ldquo;Photography is my Passion and Editing my Meditation.&rdquo; Creating something artistic and unique out of nothing embedded with a straightforward approach is the best part of my passion for photography. Monochrome and Nature fascinate me the most. I am passionate about the entrancing beauty of the colorful birds as they are a symbol of FREEDOM. I always try to portray the beauty of the world in my own style while catching the innocent exquisiteness of nature and humankind at the right moment and understanding it in a deeper sense.</p>
