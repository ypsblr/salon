<!-- Mr. Chandrashekar S, AFIP -->
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Mr. Chandrashekar, Treasurer, YPS, was bit by shutter-bug way back in the late eighties when he visited one of the YPS Photography Exhibitions held in Venkatappa Art Gallery. At the exhibition he met Mr. H Satish, Mr. A K Raju, Mr. M S Hebbar, Mr. K S Rajaram and others who influenced him to get into photography. After that he got into serious amateur photography activities, participated in several national and international salons, won awards and certificates of merit. He also got his AFIAP distinction. His passion for photography still continues and, of late, he has been shooting macros [along with Mr. Nagaraj]. But his heart is with bird photography. He is an outdoors man and enjoys all the things nature has to offer. Weekends are dedicated to birding or butterfly walks.</p>
