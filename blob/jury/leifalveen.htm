	<p class="text-justify">Mr. Leif Alveen is a Danish (Denmark) photographer with a lifelong interest in taking pictures. After a lengthy 
		break from photography, he got back into it around 10 years ago, and since 2010 he has been a regular participant in international 
		photo competitions, resulting in more than 400 awards from around the globe and has exhibited pictures in more than 80 countries.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify;">He has no set style â€“ it is more a case of going where the image takes him. The subject decides the 
		treatment the picture gets, from very naturalistic to heavily photoshopped. Subjects range just as wide with a tendency towards 
		travel images and semi-long to long exposures.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify;">Mr. Alveen is the former President of the Society of Danish Photography (SDF) and co-founder of the 
		Scandinavian Stella Polaris photo group and the Lanterna Magica small prints exhibition.
