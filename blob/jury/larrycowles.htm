		His interest in photography started when he was in high school but really started to develop while he was in the military, 
		learning to process black &amp; white images in the base darkroom.  Working in the film processing industry for ten years 
		gave him the skills to teach photography and after winning a company photo contest, he was hooked on entering state fairs 
		and local camera store contests and later exhibitions. While he participates in many types of photography, he specializes 
		in portraits. Travel, teaching photography, judging, lecturing, presenting photography programs, and writing for the PSA 
		Journal and other publications has helped Larry to develop his photographic skills and his ability to compete worldwide 
		in photography exhibitions.
