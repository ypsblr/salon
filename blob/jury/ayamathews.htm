<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">After working with State Bank of India, the leading bank in India, for 31 years, Vinaya Mathews decided to quit her job in 2014, from the position of Chief Manager, to pursue her two passions, working for the under-privileged and photography.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Her journey in the field of photography started with a basic course conducted by Late Prof. Manohar Desai, the Founder Director of National Institute of Photography, in Mumbai, India, in the year 2004. With the feel of a camera in hand, she discovered her over-arching love for photography. It took her 10 long restless years to finally free herself from the bonds of a demanding career and follow her passion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In March 2018, she attended 12th batch of &lsquo;Gurukul Of Photographic Art&rsquo; where she learned philosophy of photography from an eminent photographer Dr Shivji Joshi. She learned five mantras of photography from him i.e. &lsquo;Line, Light, Life, Vision &amp; Visualisation&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">During last eight years, she has earned distinction &lsquo;Excellence FIAP&rsquo; (EFIAP) from &lsquo;The International Federation of Photographic Art&rsquo; Belgium, &lsquo;Proficiency Photographic Society of America (PPSA)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gold Exhibitor of APU (GAPU) from Asia Photographers Union, &lsquo;Master of Federation Of Indian Photography (MFIP) &amp; &lsquo;MFIP &ndash; Nature&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">She idolises ex-president of India, late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam and his beautiful quote &ldquo;Dream is not that you see in sleep, Dream is something that does not let you sleep&rdquo; is a reverberating source of inspiration for her.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Her dream is to gain distinctive knowledge and experience in the field to become an accomplished photographer.</p>
