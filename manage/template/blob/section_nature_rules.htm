		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Nature photography is restricted to the use of the photographic process to depict all branches of natural history,
			except anthropology and archeology, in such a fashion that a well-informed person will be <b>able to identify the
			subject material and certify its honest presentation</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>story telling value</b> of a photograph must be weighed more than the pictorial quality while maintaining
				high technical quality.</li>
			<li><b>Human elements</b> shall not be present, except where those human elements are integral parts of the nature
				story such as nature subjects, like barn owls or storks, adapted to an environment modified by humans, or where
				those human elements are in situations depicting natural forces, like hurricanes or tidal waves.</li>
			<li><b>Scientific bands</b>, scientific tags or radio collars on wild animals <b>are permissible.</b></li>
			<li>Photographs of <b>human created</b> hybrid plants, cultivated plants, feral animals, domestic animals, or mounted
				specimens are <b>ineligible</b>, as is any form of manipulation that alters the truth of the photographic statement.</li>
			<li>No techniques that add, relocate, replace, or remove pictorial elements except by cropping are permitted.</li>
			<li>Techniques that enhance the presentation of the photograph without changing the nature story or the pictorial content,
				or without altering the content of the original scene, are <b>permitted including HDR, focus stacking and
				dodging/burning</b>.</li>

				are allowed.</li>

			Images entered in Nature sections meeting the Nature Photography Definition above can have landscapes, geologic formations,
			weather phenomena, and extant organisms as the primary subject matter.  This includes images taken with subjects in
			controlled conditions, such as zoos, game farms, botanical gardens, aquariums and any enclosure where the subjects are
			totally dependent on man for food.
