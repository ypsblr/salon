			Youth Photographic Society, Bengaluru, is one of the oldest and prestigious Photography Clubs in India
			established in 1971. As of now, the Society boasts of 250+ Life Members, 200+ Individual members and
			numerous internationally acclaimed photographers. We are proud that we hold the highest number
			of international distinction holders in the country and look forward to flourishing further.

		<p class="text text-justified">YPS has held 34 All India and 9 International salons and currently gearing towards the 10th International
			Salon, 2018. We were excited to have the exclusive category of 35th YPS All India Salon committee which
			allowed cost-free participation from youth up to 18 years of age. We were truly encouraged by the
			number of entries received from across India. This astounding success was possible only because I had
			the privilege of working with a talented, thoughtful and diligent team.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I am grateful for their insights and for their superb work. The inhouse Salon Judging software was also fine tuned and accentuated with few
			more features based on the feedback from our Judges of the previous YPS International Salon.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">We pledged our commitment to the Digital Economy of the country by digitally processing all the payments, made by the participants and
			Sponsors, through the seamless digital payment gateway on our website. Open-Judging, a transparent process, where the participants not
			only have the opportunity of viewing their Scores Live but also assessing where each picture ranks/stands throughout the process. The
			distinguished juries, who are eminent Photographers themselves, conducted the evaluation of the images with great conscience and
			unbiased expertise to which I am deeply indebted. I Congratulate each of you for the magnificent and stunning Pictures!
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">As the Chairman of the YPS 35th All India Salon, I feel honored and thank the Photography fraternity for contributing to the salon in making
			it a huge success! For us who have been planning and working in the committee; there has been a lot of work, tremendous amount of
			enjoyment and an amazing feeling of work well accomplished. I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to the Award Sponsors, Print
			Sponsors - Technova, Media Partners - PrajaVani, and 92.7 Big FM who immensely supported the success of the Salon. I thank our own YPS
			Executive Committee and my adherent & steadfast Salon Committee members for their commitment to excel. Last but not at anyway the
			least, I appreciate and thank all of the senior members of the YPS EC, the YPS Salon Committee. My very special thanks go to Mr. H. Satish,
			YPS President, for believing the younger generation and entrusting us with this incredible experience and for constantly being the guiding
			factor.
