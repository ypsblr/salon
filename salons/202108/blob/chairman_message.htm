			<b>Etched in Gold:</b> First and foremost I express my gratitude to the executive committee for entrusting me with the role of a chairperson in this very
			prestigious and historic salon of our Golden Jubilee year. I am humbled and honored to be the first woman salon chairperson in the
			history of YPS. This being YPS Golden Jubilee Year, the All India Digital Salon 2021 is etched in gold in the annals of YPS history
			for many reasons!
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">The executive committee was determined to make the salon very special. The first step was to make
			Participation Free for all and for the first time, we have our own customised and classy YPS Medals. Along with the
			regular awards, special prestigious awards in the name of eight Photography Legends of Karnataka were instituted.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">With the unexpected demise of Sri Neginhal, Hon YPS, an award in the Nature Section was also instituted in
			his memory. Young Talent Awards encourage the young photographers too. We continued with the tradition of
			offering cash awards to encourage photographers.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">YPS salons are very popular with photographers and this being free participation combined with wide publicity
			resulted in a flood of entries. <b>My heartfelt gratitude to all the 1,039 authors who submitted a whopping 13,321
			works in 4 sections and created a National Record.</b> The salon has truly helped popularise the Art of Photography.
			A large number of first time participants showed their eagerness to learn the Art of Photography! I certainly
			hope they will take their passion forward for this great art form.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">My sincere gratitude to the eminent jury members who used their rich photographic knowledge to choose
			the best photos for awards. Judging the huge number of entries in each section was a daunting task as the
			session had also to be webcast live. Hope you enjoyed the pictures and the four days of live scoring. For the
			first time we had the presence of &quot;Salon Saathi&quot; of FIP during the award selection process and I am sure they
			were impressed by the transparent and efficient manner in which YPS salons are conducted.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Unique and attractive downloadables were designed not only for the award winners but for each and every
			participant, thereby emphasizing the importance of participation. We at YPS are committed to paying	minute attention to every detail,
			to give the best to every photographer who associates with us!
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Dear friends, do thumb through the catalog and enjoy the excellent works. Keep your passion going strong, keep
			learning and enjoy every step of the way!
