			This is a MONOCHROME OPEN section that accepts Grayscale and Toned Grayscale images fitting the following definitions.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			An image is considered to be Monochrome only if it gives the impression of having no color (i.e. contains only shades
			of grey which can include pure black and pure white) OR it gives the impression of being a greyscale image that has been
			toned in one color across the entire image. (For example by Sepia, red, gold, etc.)  A greyscale or multi-colored image modified
			or giving the impression of having been modified by partial toning, multi-toning or by the inclusion of spot coloring does not
			meet the definition of monochrome and shall be classified as a Color Work.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Digital creation pictures are allowed under this section provided they conform to the condition that
			the entry must have one or more elements that have originated as photographs.
			All elements of the image must have been shot by the author. No part of the image should have been taken
			from Net or other person's image. Use of some filters available on net is permissible.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Monochrome Grayscale images (that is without tone) may not be entered in Color Open sections. Grayscale images may be entered
			in Nature and Travel sections, but toned images are not permitted under Nature and Travel sections.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Submission of same images either colour or mono in two different section of the same Salon will result in disqualification
			for both the images.
