				technical quality.</li>

				such as nature subjects, like barn owls or storks, adapted to an environment modified by humans, or where those human
				elements are in situations depicting natural forces, like hurricanes or tidal waves.</li>
			<li><b>Scientific bands</b>, scientific tags or radio collars on wild animals <b>are permissible.</b></li>
