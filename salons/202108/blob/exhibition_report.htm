			Due to the relaxations made by the Govt. of Karnataka, the Salon Committee and the YPS Exceutive Committee decided to
			hold a print exhibition for three days from Friday, August 20 to Sunday, August 22 at Chitrakala Parishath, the hub
			of art, in Bangalore. Of course, all precautions were taken to see that the exhibition and function conforms to the
			covid norms.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			We received printable files for 67 of the 69 award winning images. These were printed on non-tear exhibition paper
			from Technova and framed to present them in full grandeur. Each picture was accompanied by title cards showing the
			picture title and the author information. The YPS Salon Committee and volunteers of YPS were present to guide the
			visitors.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			All the accepted images were displayed as a slideshow on a large TV. Each slide contained the picture title, author
			details, award details and, where available, EXIF information. Many visitors sat in front of the display and enjoyed
			the slideshow.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Thanks to the efforts made by K S Rajaram, Salon Committee Member, the exhibition gained wide publicity on many newspapers
			like Prajavani and Deccan Herald. Doordarshan covered the function and telecast in on their news channel on August 21st.
