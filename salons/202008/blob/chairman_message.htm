			YPS has held 37 All India and 13 International salons, this being the 38th edition of All India Salon. 
			We are extremely thankful to all the all the 299 participants who submitted 3377 wonderful pictures 
			including 155 pictures from 16 Youth Participants for the Salon. I congratulate each of you for the 
			magnificent and stunning pictures! The entire team is proud of the same.

		<p class="text text-justified">Exclusive category for youth under the age of 18 years with free participation 
			introduced a few years back to encourage the younger generationâ€™s participation, was retained in this 
			salon. I am happy to inform you that after the judging session it felt good to hear from the jury that 
			the pictures under the youth category were of a high standard and complimented YPS for having an exclusive 
			category for youth. This means that this endeavour of YPS is bearing fruits, and helping the youth to 
			showcase their talents.

		<p class="text text-justified">The Salon website used had been designed and developed to ensure a delightful 
			experience to participants while registering, uploading the images and in making payment. The in-house 
			developed salon judging software was fine-tuned to facilitate online remote judging sessions. I am extremely 
			thankful to Shri Murali Santhanam, the architect of our website and judging software, for his dedicated efforts.

		<p class="text text-justified">In the wake of COVID 19 pandemic, we could not meet for the open judging sessions 
			as was being done every year. Our team rose to the occasion and came up with a brilliant solution; it was 
			exciting to have the remote salon judging process live on Facebook, with the scoring of images by jury 
			available in real-time for the participants and photography lovers across the globe. This was the first 
			of its kind in the country, if not the world. An added feature was to have some of the jury members in our 
			live session addressing the viewers. My sincere thanks to Shri Manju Vikas Sastry V and Shri Hardik P Shah 
			for conceptualizing and executing it to perfection, which invited appreciation from all quarters. I may not 
			be wrong in saying that we have created a history of sorts. The distinguished jury, all of whom are eminent 
			photographers themselves, conducted the evaluation of the images with great conscience and unbiased expertise 
			to which I am deeply indebted.

		<p class="text text-justified">I am extremely honoured to be the salon chairman and thank the YPS Executive
			Committee and the All India salon committee for entrusting me with the conduct of the salon. I was 
			privileged to have a dedicated team who gave their 100 per cent in making this salon a great success. 
			My sincere thanks go to Smt Prema Kakade, salon secretary for actively involving in every aspect with 
			dedication, full zeal and enthusiasm. Shri M S Kakade was a perfect fit for the role of treasurer, 
			keeping things in control, especially with regard to finance and accounts. Design Team of Shri Hardik Shah,
			Shri Nandan Hegde and Shri Girish Mayachari with the support of Shri Chetan Rao Mane, catered to all design 
			requirements for publicity, salon certificates etc. my heartfelt thanks to them. Shri K S Rajaram with his 
			deep-rooted contacts in the media fraternity contributed his might to get good coverage in the print media, 
			I take this opportunity on behalf of my entire team to extend sincere thanks to him. The well-designed salon 
			catalog, now in your hands, is the result of dedicated efforts by Shri Rajasimha S, who has been the designer 
			for the past few salons. His designing has drawn appreciation from all quarters. I, on behalf of the salon 
			committee, extend sincere gratitude to him.

		<p class="text text-justified">As the Chairman of the YPS All India Digital Salon 2020, I feel honoured and 
			thank the photography fraternity for contributing to the salon and making it a huge success! For us who 
			have been planning and working in the committee; there has been a lot of work, a tremendous amount of 
			enjoyment and an amazing feeling of work well accomplished. I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks 
			to the Award Sponsors and Media Partners, who immensely supported to the success of the Salon. Last but 
			not the least, I appreciate and thank all the senior YPS members & past Executive Committee members for 
			their continuous support. My very special thanks go to Shri H Satish, YPS President, for believing in the 
			younger generation and entrusting us with this incredible experience and for constantly being the guiding 
			factor.
