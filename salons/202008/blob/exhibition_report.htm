			The conduct of a salon is incomplete without an exhibition of the photographs. Due to the prevailing situation, brought about by the pandemic, 
			a physical exhibition was ruled out. The salon committee, encouraged by the overwhelming response for the online judging session, decided to 
			go live once again to inaugurate the Salon Exhibition.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			On 26th July, 2020 at 10.30 am the live session started off with a beautifully rendered invocation song by Mrs. Sunitha Rani Girish. This was 
			followed by the presidential address and introduction of Guest of Honour, Padma Shri awardee Shri Anup Sah. Salon Chairman gave a brief on the 
			salon and introduced the salon committee members. Mr. Anup Sah recalled how it was prestigious to take part in YPS Salons and how he coveted
			the awards he won in YPS Salons. Next up, release of the catalog saw a deluge of messages by viewers wanting to know how they 
			could get a copy of the beautifully designed and printed catalog.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			Salon Secretary then presented the statistics of the salon. This included some very interesting tit-bits like the youngest and oldest participants, 
			top 5 performers, club wise statistics and much more. All these statistics are available on the website.

		</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			At this juncture there was a surprise waiting for the viewers. The answer to their question, how will the photographs be exhibited, was answered. 
			A digital virtual exhibition was inaugurated by Shri. Anup Sah and the Web Master walked the audience through the virtual exhibitio. After signing
			a Visitor Book, the person visiting the Exhibition is taken to the Main Lobby with boards that will take you to any of the 6 halls exhibiting 
			pictures of the Best Participant, the Best Club and a hall each for the four sections Monochrome, Colour, Nature and Travel. The Webmaster took the
			Guest of Honor and along with him the participants of the Award Ceremony through several halls. Each hall had a 3-D visual of pictures framed and
			hung on walls along with tent cards. The audience were shown the overall layout of the hall with 3 walls having pictures. They were taken closer
			to the picture to have close look in a free form navigation mode called &quot;Room&quot; mode. The Webmaster also showed another way of walking
			along the walls to look at each picture on the ball through simpler navigation in what is called the &quot;Picture&quot; mode.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			To complete the user experience, many of the pictures had video presentation of the picture by the author of the picture. In a 30 second recorded
			video, the author explained how and why a picture was clicked. As a demonstration, the Webmaster showed the video of a Youth Participant
			explaining her picture of Elephant herd with a new-born calf.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			The Webmaster also took time to demonstrate the other features of the Salon, like, &quot;Full House Masters&quot;, &quot;Portfolio Display&quot;
			and how to access all Salon data since 2016. He then demonstrated the long history of YPS by showing a section containing all the past catalogs
			extending all the way to the first Salon held in 1977.

			<span class="border-color">Acknowledgment of Winners</span>
		</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			This was followed by acknowledgment of all award winning pictures and their authors. This was led by Girish Mayachari.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			The Award Ceremony closed with vote of thanks by YPS Secretary. The 2 hour program ended on a high note with excellent feedback from visitors, 
			Salon participants and YPS Members and with wide media coverage with news shared in 5+ magazines and 2 TV channels.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			All participants were subsequently provided with links to view/download Salon Catalog, to download certificates in PDF Format and also to order 
			catalogs. It is time to complete sending of medals and certificates and take the Salon to a closure.</p>
