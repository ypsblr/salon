			Just like the previous occasions, judging for YPS International Salon 2018 was completed professionally in an open environment
			with live scores for the participants. This time, the Salon also had two print sections, a first time experience
			ever since we started using the present digital judging system. But it went very smooth thanks to the preparations
			made by the Salon Committee members. The judges and the participants had an enjoyable time. The judging process
			ensured fair and equal chance to every photograph submitted by the participants so that the best of the lot can
			walk away with the prizes.
		</p>
		<p>We want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the jury, people who joined at the venue to make the
			event memorable, YPS Executive Committee members, Salon Committee members and volunteers who helped during the
			judging.</p>
