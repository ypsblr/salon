			We are proud that we hold the highest number of international distinction holders in the country and 
			look forward to flourishing further.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">YPS has held 35 All India and 10 International salons and currently gearing 
			towards the 11th International Salon, 2019.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">We were excited to have the exclusive category of cost-free participation 
			youth up to 18 years of age. We were truly encouraged by the number of entries received from across 
			India. This astounding success was possible only because I had the privilege of working with a talented, 
			thoughtful and diligent team. I am grateful for their insights and superb work.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">It was exciting to have the Salon Judging process go live and available 
			as a webcast for all the participants and photography lovers across the globe, which is the first 
			of its kind in the country, if not the world, as per our knowledge.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">We are extremely thankful to all the participants who submitted 2902 
			wonderful pictures for the Salon, which is a record for the highest number of pictures submitted 
			in the history of YPS for a salon having 4 sections. I congratulate each of you for the magnificent 
			and stunning pictures! The entire Team is proud of the same.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">The in-house developed Salon Judging software was also fine-tuned and 
			accentuated with few more features based on the feedback from our Judges of the previous YPS 
			International Salon.

		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Open-Judging, a transparent process, where the participants not only 
			have the opportunity of viewing their scores live but also assessing where each picture ranks/stands 
			throughout the process. The distinguished jury, all of whom are eminent photographers themselves, 
			conducted the evaluation of the images with great conscience and unbiased expertise to which 
			I am deeply indebted.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I am extremely honoured to be the Salon Chairman for the 2nd time and 
			thank the YPS Executive Committee and the All India Salon Committee for trusting me in the execution 
			of the Salon. This definitely increases the responsibility shouldered on me.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">As the Chairman of the YPS 36th All India Salon, I feel honoured and thank 
			the photography fraternity for contributing to the salon and making it a huge success! For us who have 
			been planning and working in the committee; there has been a lot of work, a tremendous amount of 
			enjoyment and an amazing feeling of work well accomplished. I would like to convey my heartfelt 
			thanks to the Award Sponsors, Print Sponsors - Technova, All the Media Partners, who immensely 
			supported towards the success of the Salon. I thank our own YPS Executive Committee and my adherent 
			& steadfast Salon Committee members for their commitment to excel. Last but not at anyway the least, 
			I appreciate and thank all the senior YPS members & past Executive Committees for their continuous 
			support. My very special thanks go to Mr. H. Satish, YPS President, for believing in the younger 
			generation and entrusting us with this incredible experience and for constantly being the guiding 
			factor.
