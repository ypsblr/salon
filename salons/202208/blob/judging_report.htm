<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the standards of YPS, judging for [contest-name] was completed professionally in an open environment with live scores for the participants. The judging was also webcast live through YouTube and Facebook. More than 50 people watched the webcast of scoring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges and the participants had an enjoyable time. The judging process ensured fair and equal chance to every photograph submitted by the participants so that the best of the lot can walk away with the prizes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most jury members appreciated the arrangements, support from organizers and the quality of the judging software which made the scoring and selection process very easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the jury, people who joined at the venue to make the event memorable, YPS Executive Committee members, Salon Committee members and volunteers who helped during the judging.</p>
