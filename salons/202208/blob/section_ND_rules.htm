<li><strong>NATURE definition</strong> - Nature Photography is restricted to the use of the photographic process to depict all branches of natural history, except anthropology and archaeology, in such a fashion that a well-informed person will be able to identify the subject matter and certify its honest presentation. The story telling value of a photograph must be weighed more than the pictorial quality while maintaining high technical quality. Images entered in NATURE section meeting the Nature Photography Definition above can have landscapes, geological formations, weather phenomena, and extant organisms as the primary subject matter.</li>
<li><strong>Pictures taken in controlled environment</strong> - This contest does not allow pictures of animals and birds in captivity, such as zoos and game farms. Pictures of other subjects in controlled conditions, such as botanical gardens, aquariums and any enclosure where the subjects are totally dependent on man for survival are allowed.</li>
<li><strong>What is WILDLIFE</strong> - WILDLIFE is not limited to mammals, birds and insects. Marine subjects and botanical subjects (including fungi and algae) taken in the wild are suitable wildlife subjects, as are carcasses of extant species.</li>
<li><strong>NO man-made elements</strong> - Human or man-made elements shall not be present in the picture, except where those elements are integral parts of the story of the picture. An example would be a picture of barn owls or other birds living in an environment modified by humans after having adapted their life to such an environment. Another exception would be inclusion of humans, human/man-made elements in situations depicting natural forces, such as hurricanes or tidal waves.</li>
<li><strong>NO domesticated subjects or subjects in captivity</strong> - Photographs of human created hybrid plants, cultivated plants, feral animals, domestic animals and mounted specimens are NOT permissible. Photographs showing subjects in captivity are not allowed.</li>

<li><strong>NO Digital Creation Pictures</strong> - Digital Creation pictures are NOT allowed under this section.</li>
<li><strong>MONOCHROME allowed</strong> - Nature Color images can be converted to gray-scale monochrome.</li>
<li><strong>Post-processing for Natural Presentation permitted</strong> - Techniques that enhance the presentation of the photograph while preserving the nature story, original scene and the pictorial content are permitted. This includes basic post-processing techniques such as Cropping, Burning, Dodging, Exposure correction, hue/saturation adjustments, sharpening and noise reduction, and advanced techniques such as spot removal, HDR, Luminosity Masks and Focus Stacking. Final image presented must appear natural. Selective darkening of background is prohibited.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Post-processing that changes the scene are not permitted</strong> - Techniques that add, relocate, replace, or remove pictorial elements (except by cropping) are NOT permitted.
