<!-- Contest Description -->
<p class="text text-justified"><img style="margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; float: left;" src="../salons/[contest-yearmonth]/img/com/[salon-chairman-avatar]"> I would like to personally thank every one who has participated in the [contest-name]. YPS has re-introduced Print Sections after a gap of 3 years and the judging was also performed at the judging-venue instead of remote judging. The same was also webcast over Facebook and Youtube channels of YPS to facilitate participants from other locations to have a view of the scoring process.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text text-justified">I also would like to thank the members of Jury for the excellent support and diligent judging making it easy to finalize the awards and acceptances.</p>
<p class="text text-justified">The judging sessions and awards were sponsored by sponsors. Our sincere thanks to all of them who have financially supported the salon.</p>
<p class="text text-justified">The volunteers of YPS played a great part in making the event run seamlessly on all three days of judging. The Salon Committee and YPS Executive Committee joins hands to thank each and every volunteer.</p>
<p class="text text-justified">We are in the process of finalizing the plans for the exhibition. The same will be announced once details are ready. My personal invitation to each one of you to come and visit the exhibition and join the award function.</p>
