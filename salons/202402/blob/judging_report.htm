<p>The YPS National Salon 2024 was skillfully guided by a great Salon team. To ensure a seamless judging process, we implemented online judging with a distinctive jury comprising a total of 12 members across four sections. We are pleased to note that each jury member diligently completed their scoring within the designated time frame. Furthermore, the jury meetings for award finalization were flawlessly conducted in the presence of the FIP Salon Saathi, adhering to the predetermined schedule. The judging process was successfully concluded before the scheduled webcast on the weekend, allowing for a seamless transition into the public viewing phase.</p>
<p>We are proud to acknowledge our webmaster, Smita Goyal, who demonstrated exceptional competence in managing the unique and highly professional judging software. The relentless dedication of the YPS President, Vikas Sastry, and the Salon Chairperson, Anitha Mysore, played a pivotal role in the Salon's smooth execution. Both were available round the clock, providing unwavering support.</p>
<p>To enhance the participants' and viewers' experience, the scores were webcast in four sessions, corresponding to each section. Beginning from the second session, the awards were announced at the commencement of each session. This process enabled YPS patrons to observe the competent jury members meticulously scoring each image from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>For the convenience of those who couldn't attend the webcast, recordings are made available on YouTube, ensuring wider access to the proceedings.</p>
<p>We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the jury members, the participants of the webcast, the YPS Executive Committee members, the Salon Committee members, and the dedicated volunteers who provided invaluable assistance during the judging process.</p>
