<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the standards of YPS, judging for [contest-name] was completed professionally in an open environment with live scores for the participants. The judging was also telecast live through YouTube and more than 35 people joined from the outside the hall. The judges and the participants had an enjoyable time. The judging process ensured fair and equal chance to every photograph submitted by the participants so that the best of the lot can walk away with the prizes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a quote from Threesh Kapoor who participated in YPS judging for the first time: <em>"It was really a wonderful experience joining as a member of jury for YPS National Digital Salon 2019. For last few years I was busy with my Himalaya Study Center and Retreat construction but this year when I got invitation from Satish Sir I could not say no. Your digital software is outstanding. My complements to the members who designed it. I will request YPS to share it with other clubs in India to promote it. Your all arrangements for judging and the enthusiasm of members was wonderful. It was wonderful meeting my old friends. During other judgings I had the pleasure of seeing work of Banglorians, when they use to sweep all the awards in nature section, but meeting them in person was a beautiful experience. Encouraging the youth to participate, you have started a new section for them they must take advantage of it. I was impressed to see the very good standard of entries in this salon. We need to arrange a workshop for judging of salons and I feel with over 700 members YPS can take lead in this area. All arrangements during the judging were excellent for which the salon committee and executive committee deserve compliments. Overall best performing club of India YPS under the guidance of its president Mr H Satish and other members deserve compliments."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the jury, people who joined at the venue to make the event memorable, YPS Executive Committee members, Salon Committee members and volunteers who helped during the judging.</p>
