				Whatever little or much experience that I had while being a jury member at International and National Salons over the years, somehow changed while being at the jury sessions of YPS National Salon,2024.I remember that some months ago,as Anitha Mysoreji had invited me for the jury duties at the Travel section of her salon, I felt very honored. It is not only that the invitation came  from a prestigious club like Youth Photographic Society, Bangalore , but also due to the fact that among the several eligible and qualified ones, the organisers have chosen me for the job.
I really don't know to what extent I had fulfilled their expectations , but I have tried my best. 
To be honest - I felt that the organisers had made the sessions easier for me by the way they had managed every aspect of the judging process.The judging software , the award finalisation discussion sessions and the punctuality and the discipline that they had followed is exemplary .

Thanks to YPS, it is not only a great time with you, but a learning experience for me too .
I acknowledge your cooperation and the way you have honored me.
