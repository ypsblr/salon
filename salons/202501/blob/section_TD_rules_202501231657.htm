<p>A Photo Travel image expresses the characteristic features or culture of a land as they are found naturally. There are no geographical limitations. The following restrictions apply to pictures submitted under the TRAVEL Section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images of individuals or groups must show their environment or location.</li>
<li>The image should not be a SET-UP image and it should not be a directed image. Images from events or <strong>activities arranged</strong> specifically for photography, or of subjects directed or hired for photography are not permitted. It should not be from a PHOTO WORKSHOP where a troupe dances for the workshop organizer or HORSES are made to run in dust or water or an individual shows his acrobatics on payment of a fee.</li>
<li>Many monasteries have religious festivals with dances etc and it is perfectly legal to submit such images though you may have paid an entry fee. The same is true for ballet and other stage shows. These are public performances and are not arranged specifically for a group of photographers.</li>
<li>Techniques that add, relocate, replace, or remove any element of the original image, except by cropping, are not permitted. The only allowable adjustments are the removal of dust or digital noise, restoration of the appearance of the original scene, and complete conversion to greyscale monochrome. Other derivations, including infrared, are not permitted. Stitching of two or more images is not permitted. All images must look natural.</li>
<li>Complete conversion to greyscale Monochrome is allowed but without partial or complete toning.</li>
<li>Drone photography is permitted if it is permissible at the locations where the picture was shot.</li>
</ul>
