<p>Nature photography is restricted to the use of the photographic process to depict all branches of natural history, except anthropology and archeology, in such a fashion that a well-informed person will be able to <strong>identify the subject</strong> and certify its <strong>honest presentation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>story telling value</strong> of a photograph must be weighed more than the pictorial quality while maintaining high technical quality.</li>
<li><strong>Human elements</strong> shall not be present, except where those human elements are integral parts of the nature story such as nature subjects, like barn owls or storks, adapted to an environment modified by humans, or where those human elements are in situations depicting natural forces, like hurricanes or tidal waves.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific bands</strong>, scientific tags or radio collars on wild animals <strong>are permissible.</strong></li>
<li>Photographs of <strong>human created</strong> hybrid plants, cultivated plants, feral animals, domestic animals, or mounted specimens are <strong>ineligible</strong>, as is any form of manipulation that alters the truth of the photographic statement.</li>
<li>No techniques that add, relocate, replace, or remove pictorial elements except by cropping are permitted. Conversion to infrared, either by digital technique or by original technique is not allowed. Stitching of two or more image is not permitted.</li>
<li>Techniques that enhance the presentation of the photograph without changing the nature story or the pictorial content, or without altering the content of the original scene, are <strong>permitted including HDR, focus stacking and dodging/burning</strong>.</li>
<li>Techniques that <strong>remove elements added by the camera</strong>, such as dust spots, digital noise, and film scratches, are allowed. It is perfectly legal to remove dust, flares or digital noise. Minor global colour / tone correction is OK as long as it is not selective and the final image looks natural but not dramatic. Dodge and Burn tool is for you only but use it judiciously. Selective darkening of background is prohibited. Techniques like panning, slow shutter speed or in-exposure zooming are part of your creativity. Use of filters like Polarizers and NDs are ok.</li>
<li>Stitched images are not permitted.</li>
