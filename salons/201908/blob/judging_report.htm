		</h3>

			As in the past YPS managed 3 days of Open Judging for this Salon too. For the first time, YPS also went live during
			scoring stages for all the sections. Over 50 participants from all over the globe watched the live score sitting at their desk.
			An equal number of photo lovers, young and experienced, witnessed the scoring as well as the award finalization proceedings
			at the venue. These people had the opportunity to experience how the judges pick the winning images. They also had the
			opportunity to interact with the judges and gain knowledge. Results were immediately posted on the live stream for the
			benefit of remote participants.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
			Judging is an involved process requiring concentration. The judges spent over 2 hours on each section to assign individual scores
			and spent another hour or more to finalize images. YPS took every care to make the days of judging enjoyable, right from travel, stay,
			food and tools available for judging process. YPS used its time tested and unique judging software to help judges identify
			winning images with ease.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
			We want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the jury, people who joined at the venue to make the
			event memorable, people who joined from remote locations, YPS Executive Committee members, Salon Committee members and volunteers who helped during the
			judging.

				In my last 34 year's experience, judging all most 450 salons, contest and competitions,  I felt YPS has done a great job to maintain the 
				transparency in selection. As a jury of that salon, I have no doubt that the system implied maintaining the norms of FIAP,  and PSA is the 
				best presentation in our country. I am deeply honoured to share my experience with the other juries having no controversy at the time of 
				selection. The entire presentation was excellent. My heartfelt thanks to the webmaster for making this process so clear. With the improvement 
					of new technology, YPS has proved the best in all times. Thanks to the organisers and hope to see more in future.

				From the first International Salon back in the eighties to all the national and International salons till now, YPS has maintained a very high 
				discipline with regard to the calendar schedules, judging, exhibition and all other execution activity.  This Salon went a step ahead with live 
				streaming of the judging process enabling distant participants to view the judging process.

				With the digital era an entire turn over of the imaging quality could be witnessed.  Technology is playing a big part in imaging not only 
				during the shoot but later on the computer as well.  However, no digital technology can ever take over ‘Art’.  This is where a photo competition 
				plays a big part.  It provides an opportunity for the photographer to portray his thought, his idea, his subject, his lighting, technicality and 
				not his gadgets.  It is the judge’s part to tare away the technological veil of the picture and see the photographer’s ability in making that image.

				I would congratulate the Youth Photographic Society for striving hard to popularize photography through their workshops, group discussions, outings, 
				mentoring and guidance.  They keep it simple : If you love photography, we love you.

				Firstly, it was an honour and a privilege to have shared jury services with eminent photographers &amp; personalities from the field.  Images submitted 
				from over 30 countries is in itself a fantastic response to the Salon.  Each of the entries were of very good quality and the criteria of “essence 
				of a good wildlife photograph” was certainly met In most of the images, if not all; making it hard for us to arrive at the final list. The transparency, 
				maturity and selection process were of the highest standards, and it consistently reflected in the scoring.

				After the first round of selections, it really got tight to finalise the Medal winners; and I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion and debate we had 
				amongst ourselves. In the end it worked out alright and it was heartening to note that Indian wildlife photographers are now standing shoulder-to-shoulder 
				along with their international peers.  Kudos to the organisers to have provided professional technology &amp; logistics support, without which the entire 
				process would not have been this seamless and enjoyable.

				In the world of salon/exhibition Photography, where there are many factors that encourage as well as discourage participation, where factors affect 
				the conduct or misconduct of its organisation; the YPS International Salon has been most exemplary, a jewel among a diverse crowd of salons, proving 
				time and again over the years, that not only does it maintain an exemplary standard but strives to improve the quality with innovative use of 
				technology and ideas. For me it is the Gold Standard in Salons. This can happen only when there is leadership and teamwork. For that YPS has a leader 
				in H.Satish, with a remarkable experience and commitment. I am always impressed with the way he has achieved to harness and in years build a team 
				which would be the envy of any other Photographic entity. Each aspect of the YPS International Salon reflects careful planning and implementation. 
				I need to emphasize the salon website and the software for judging, which are professionally created in-house. The website is most user-friendly 
				and importantly retains a database for participants. The judging process with the IT maverick Murali Santhanam at the helm of affairs ensured 
				that the record number of entrants and entries spread over 6 sections was a seamless process. I am sure my esteemed colleagues in the panel of 
				jury would agree that we had a great time judging the entries in the presence of the public. The innovative use of live broadcast of the judging 
				in its trial version and a first of its kind in the world is most impressive. These and many more aspects of YPS International Salon are benchmarks 
				for other salons to emulate. Thank you for having me and for the opportunity to be part of this most exciting and memorable event.
