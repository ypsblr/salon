			<li>Use <i>Request Group Discount</i> option in the user side menu to request discount. You will be required to specify the promised
				minimum number of participants and mode of payment (Group Payment or Individual Payment) while making the request.</li>
			<li>An email will be generated to the Salon Committee. A member of Salon Committee will get in touch with you and then set up discount.</li>
			<li>You will then be able to add emails of participating members from your group/club. An email with discount coupon will be sent to all the participants added.</li>
		</ol>
