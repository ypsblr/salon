			It’s a proud moment for Photo artists across the world
			for having participated in the International Digital
			Salon 2021, commemorating our Golden Jubilee. Youth
			Photographic Society, India’s leading photography club
			has organized over 50 National and International salons
			to date and has set precedence for other salons to follow
			in all aspects. The quality and transparency that we at YPS
			strive for, cannot be matched. The Executive Committee
			and Salon Committee members have worked very hard
			to see that we got a record number of entries. Judging
			17451 pictures was no mean feat. The master software
			has done the job perfectly in all aspects, to the utmost
			satisfaction of all international judges. YPS is the pioneer
			in open judging, allowing all the participants to witness
			the live display of scores, and this time, it was webcast
			live across the world and all participants could see their
			marks, in the live sessions.

		<p class="text text-justified">The Golden Jubilee year of Youth Photographic
			Society is being celebrated in many ways which include
			workshops, exhibitions, talks etc. On the salon front,
			we have made both All India and International Salons
			free for participation. I must thank Vikas Sastry, YPS
			and International Salon Secretary, for suggesting this
			excellent idea. We have gained faith and trust from salon
			entrants. We consider this as an exponential service to
			the Art of Photography
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">The prestigious jury with an outstanding caliber has
			picked the best pictures from thousands, befitting
			an international salon. We are very happy with their
			judging and thank them for giving their precious time
			and patience in judging more than 4000 images in each
			section.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I thank all our salon participants for their overwhelming
			response and look forward to their continued
			participation in our future salons in support of the Art of
			Photography.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">The International Photography Federations like PSA, FIAP,
			ICS, GPU, FIP and MoL have been kind enough to give us
			patronages. We are ever grateful to the office bearers
			of ICS, GPU, Mol and FIP for giving us the patronage,
			medals and ribbons free of cost, thereby making our
			golden jubilee memorable. I take this opportunity to
			thank Mr Mohammed Arfan Asif, Mr Subrata Bysak and
			Mr Bhupesh Little, for their love and commitment to YPS
			and for contributing to the success of this salon.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">The unconditional support from all the committee
			members is laudable; if not for their support, this would
			not have been so successful. I dedicate this salon to both
			Executive and Salon Committee members.
