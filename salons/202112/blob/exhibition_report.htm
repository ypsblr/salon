			After many hits and misses caused by Corona measures taken by the Government, the Salon Committee
			and the YPS Executive Committee was finally able to put up the winning frames at the Deveraj Urs
			Gallery at Chitrakala Parishath, the most popular art destination in Bengaluru, India.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			We received printable files for 159 of the 163 award winning images. These were printed on non-tear
			exhibition paper from Technova and framed to present them in their full grandeur. Each picture was
			accompanied by a title card showing the picture title, country flag and the author information.
			The YPS Salon Committee and volunteers of YPS were present to guide the visitors.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			All the accepted images were displayed as a slideshow on a large TV. Each slide contained the picture
			title, author details, award details and, where available, EXIF information. Many visitors sat in front
			of the display and enjoyed the slideshow.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">
			The exhibition was attended by around 200 visitors.
