<p>Nature photography is restricted to the use of the photographic process to depict all branches of natural history, except anthropology and archeology, in such a fashion that a well-informed person will be <strong>able to identify the subject material and certify its honest presentation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>story telling value</strong> of a photograph must be weighed more than the pictorial quality while maintaining high technical quality.</li>
<li><strong>Human elements</strong> shall not be present, except where those human elements are integral parts of the nature story such as nature subjects, like barn owls or storks, adapted to an environment modified by humans, or where those human elements are in situations depicting natural forces, like hurricanes or tidal waves.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific bands</strong>, scientific tags or radio collars on wild animals <strong>are permissible.</strong></li>
<li>Photographs of <strong>human created</strong> hybrid plants, cultivated plants, feral animals, domestic animals, or mounted specimens are <strong>ineligible</strong>, as is any form of manipulation that alters the truth of the photographic statement.</li>
<li>No techniques that add, relocate, replace, or remove pictorial elements except by cropping are permitted.</li>
<li>Techniques that enhance the presentation of the photograph without changing the nature story or the pictorial content, or without altering the content of the original scene, are <strong>permitted including HDR, focus stacking and dodging/burning</strong>.</li>
<li>Techniques that <strong>remove elements added by the camera</strong>, such as dust spots, digital noise, and film scratches, are allowed.</li>
<li>Stitched images are not permitted.</li>
<li>Color images can be converted to greyscale monochrome. Toned monochrome images are not permitted under Nature section.</li>
<li>Infrared images, either direct-captures or derivations, are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Images entered in Nature sections meeting the Nature Photography Definition above can have landscapes, geologic formations, weather phenomena, and extant organisms as the primary subject matter. This includes images taken with subjects in controlled conditions, such as zoos, game farms, botanical gardens, aquariums and any enclosure where the subjects are totally dependent on man for food.</p>
<p>Grayscale images (that is without tone) may be entered in Nature and Travel sections, but toned images are not permitted under Nature section.</p>
<p><strong><em>Attention is drawn to the PSA Statement on Subject Matter which applies to all sections.</em></strong></p>
