<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">First, I would like to thank the 279 authors from 35 countries for the overwhelming response in uploading 3504 pictures. I congratulate each one for the magnificent and stunning pictures! The entire team is proud of the same. The salon enjoys international patronage from most of the popular photography federations, bringing the opportunity for participants to earn distinctions of their choice.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">YPS encourages club/group participation with discounts and it is heartening to see the same being used by clubs in India and overseas. YPS has held 41 National and 13 International salons in the past with this being the 14th International Salon.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">We were truly encouraged by the number of entries received from across the world. This astounding success was possible only because I had the privilege of working with a talented, thoughtful and diligent team. I am grateful for their insights and superb work.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">The in-house developed salon judging software was also fine-tuned and accentuated with some more features based on the feedback from our judges of the previous YPS International Salons.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Open-judging, a transparent process, where the participants not only have the opportunity to view their scores live but also assess where each picture ranks/stands throughout the process. The distinguished jury, all of whom are eminent photographers themselves, conducted the evaluation of the images with great conscience and unbiased expertise to which I am deeply indebted.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">I am extremely honored to be the International Salon Chairman for the 2nd time, 3 time National Salon Chairman and 2 time Salon Secretary in the past and thank the YPS Executive Committee for trusting me in the execution of the salon. This definitely increases the responsibility shouldered on me which I am very happy to execute.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">As the Chairman of the YPS International Digital Salon 2023, I feel honored and thank the photography fraternity for contributing to the salon and making it a huge success! For us who have been planning and working in the committee, there has been a lot of learning with a tremendous amount of enjoyment and an amazing feeling of work well accomplished. I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to the Salon partners, print partners - Technova and all the media partners who immensely contributed to the success of the salon. I thank our own YPS Executive Committee and my adherent and steadfast Salon Committee members for their commitment to excel. I would fail in my responsibility if I didn&rsquo;t thank Ms. Anitha Mysore, the Salon Secretary who shared all the responsibilities and has been a big support in the decision-making and execution of the salon. My very special thanks go to our Salon mentor Mr. Mohammed Arfan Asif for constantly being the guiding factor.</p>
