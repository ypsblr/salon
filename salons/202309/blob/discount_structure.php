			approaching us for discounts:</p>
		<table class="table table-bordered" style="max-width: 80%; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Minimum Number of Participants</th>
					<th><div class="text-center">Discount Percentage</div></th>
					<th><div class="text-center">Minimum Sections</div></th>

				<tr>
					<td>Minumum 5 participants</td>
					<td><div class="text-center">20 Percent</div></td>
					<td>Each participant will be required to participate in ALL the sections.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p class="text text-justify">To request discount, follow these simple steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Club coordinator registers himself/herself for the Salon.</li>
			<li>Use <b><i>Request Group Discount</i></b> option in the user side menu to request discount. The co-ordinator will be required
				to specify the promised minimum number of participants and mode of payment (Group Payment or Individual Payment) while
				making the request.</li>
			<li>An email will be generated to the Salon Committee. A member of Salon Committee will get in touch with the co-coordinator,
				if required, and then set up discount.</li>
			<li>The co-ordinator will then be able to create a group and add emails of participating members from your group/club.
				An email with discount coupon will be sent to all the participants added.</li>
			<li>The participant should use the same email to login or sign up. When they enter the contest and select sections for
				participation, the discount will be applied automatically.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="text text-justify">If the co-ordinator had opted for Group Payment, the co-ordinator can use the <b>Group Payment</b> option
			to select participation levels for each participant and make a single payment. When a group payment is made,
			the participant&apos;s number of sections will be automatically set to the participation level already configured and
			no payment will be requested.

		<p class="text text-justify">Members of YPS will be automatically eligible for 20% discount. They can participate in 2 sections or
			in all sections.</p>
