			It gives me immense pleasure to be the chairman for the 7th time continuously, for an International Salon organized
			by YPS. I thank you for taking part in the YPS international salons and making each one of them successful. Organizing
			an international salon is our humble attempt to exhibit the beautiful images from authors around the world to the public
			of the city of Bengaluru.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Friends, it is always a pleasure to see participation from photography enthusiasts from worldwide, with their
			wonderful images. Every year we are getting some of the best images from very renowned persons. We feel happy and
			enjoy their pictures and feel proud in exhibiting them to our citizens.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">This year, we thought of introducing the Print section and got overwhelming response from our motherland. We anticipated
			many entries from outside India, but they were very less. The reason could be the PSA recognition, which we did not get this
			time because we sent the application for recognition with a few days of delay. Despite that, artists from 16 countries participated with their excellent images.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">The judges for this International salon are all masters in their own field. Unlike many other salons, we do not mix the judges
			for the different sections. We have expert judges separately for Color open, Monochrome open, Travel and Nature sections. The judges discussed about each picture that came
			to the award stage and then decided the various awards.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I must tell you about our state of the art salon judging software that our salon secretary, Mr Murali Santhanam has
			developed. The jury panel members were awestruck with the convenience and easiness the software provided in scoring, segregating the images for various awards and marking the
			award winning images. The pictures were projected on to a big screen and not shown on Laptops for judging. Laptops were used only to give marks and check if the same picture
			is being shown on the screen. This ensured that each participating image is projected using a calibrated projector and all the jury panel members have the same view of the
			image. By the time the jury members finished their coffee, on the last day of the judging, the results were ready with the images! 
			We also introduced this year, for the first time in the history of Indian salons, a feature - during the uploading of entries, that showed your pictures which were accepted in
			the previous YPS salons. This ensured that you do not enter the same images. That was a wonderful new idea and ensured that we exhibit only new images.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I feel happy to share with you that all the 7 YPS international salons for which I worked as the committee chairman have
			been very successful, without any complaint either from the world bodies or the entrants. It’s a very difficult task to see that everything is meticulously 
			done and I must thank my salon committee members for joining hands with me despite their busy schedules and ensuring that the salon is successful. They all 
			have worked hard and I am happy that we at YPS always give importance to every minute detail, whether during judging or in catalogue designing. Each
			member is given different tasks and they do their jobs to 100% perfection. I am very happy to have them in my team!
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I must thank all print partners, co-ordinators, who responded to entrants and made prints for them and submitted. In this
			way, an entrant could save money on printing and postage. For the exhibition, Technova sponsored their world class Nova Jet Matte papers for printing the award winning images.
			The images were printed to highest exhibition standards at Prism Giclee printers free of cost. We are very grateful to both these sponsors.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">I am thankful to HP Reddington for sponsoring the world class colourful catalogue. With this kind of catalogue our YPS
			exhibition has been taken to the next level in the international salon arena.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified"> It’s my humble gratitude and thanks to all the esteemed Judges, salon participants, FIAP, FIP, ICS, GPU, and IUP for their
			continuous support for YPS International salons. We look forward to working with you all next year.
