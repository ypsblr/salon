<!-- General T & C - General Terms and Conditions from PSA -->
<h4 class="headline text-color">General Terms and Conditions prescribed by PSA</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image and Entry Requirements</strong> - This exhibition is open to anyone; however, an entry may be rejected when the Sponsor or the Exhibition Organizers, in their reasonable discretion, believes the entry does not conform to exhibition rules and these Conditions of Entry. Membership in any photographic organization is not required to participate.</li>
<li><strong>Penalties</strong>- Entries will not be accepted from any entrant who has been put on the <strong>PSA Penalties List for Ethics Violation</strong>. Entry fees are not refundable in these circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Image creation and ownership</strong><br>In all sections of the exhibition, images must originate as photographs made by the entrant. They may not incorporate identifiable images produced by anyone else (for example: clip art, replacement skies, or stock images). &nbsp;Images created in whole or in part by image creation software (frequently called &lsquo;AI&rsquo; images) are not allowed. Editing or alteration of images is permitted within the limits specified in the relevant section definitions that are available here https://psa-photo.org/page/division-definitions&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Any person submitting or attempting to submit a totally AI-generated image that does not begin with a light capture from the maker, from any Photographic Society of America exhibition, social media, event, or publication, other than for editorial purposes, shall be prohibited from PSA for a period of from 3 years to life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PSA Star Ratings</strong> - To receive proper Star ratings credit from PSA, entrants must provide their names and country exactly the same in each exhibition. Aliases are not permitted. Please contact PSA in the event of name changes or relocating to another country. Using one&rsquo;s name differently in different exhibition exposes the entrant to the risk that many of their acceptances may not be recognized by PSA Star Ratings.</li>
<li><strong>Reproduction </strong>- The entrant permits the sponsors to reproduce all or part of the entered material free of charge for publication and/or display in media related to the exhibition. This may include low resolution posting on a website. &nbsp;The Photographic Society of America (PSA) may request specific permission from entrants to reproduce entered images in its educational materials. The terms of that permission will be mutually agreed between the entrant and PSA <strong>except in the circumstances where the entered image is found to breach the PSA Ethics Policy. In those circumstances the image may be reproduced by PSA, without the entrant&rsquo;s further permission, for educational purposes to illustrate serious exhibition rule violations. For those reproductions, the entrant&rsquo;s name will be withheld</strong>.&nbsp;<br>Entries will not be accepted from entrants who indicate that their images may not be reproduced in materials related to the exhibition.&rdquo; &nbsp; The exhibition assumes no liability of any misuse of copyright.</li>
<li><strong>Re-use of Accepted Images</strong> - Any image that has been accepted in this exhibition, past or present, may not be entered again in the same Division Star Ratings Class in any future instances of this exhibition. &nbsp;It may, of course, be entered in any other PSA recognised exhibitions but <strong>must always have the same title. Re-titling in another language is not allowed</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Entry </strong>- An Entry consists of, up to and including, four (4) images entered by a single entrant into the same Section. An entrant may only enter a specific Section once. Entrants may not enter identical or similar images into the same section or different sections of the same exhibition. Similar is defined as almost identical in subject, composition, props, lighting, or technique so that a reasonable person viewing the entries together would decide the entrant has duplicated the previous image except for minor changes.</li>
<li><strong>Titles</strong> - Each image must have a unique title <strong>that is a description of the image</strong>. That unique title must be used for entry of that image or of an identical Image into any and all PSA-Recognized exhibitions. Titles must be 35 characters or fewer. No titles may be visible to the judges, and nothing in the image may identify the entrant. Titles may not include file extensions such as .jpg or .jpeg (or any other camera capture filenames such as IMG 471). Titles may not consist of personal identifiers possibly augmented by a number; or include words such as &ldquo;untitled&rdquo; or &ldquo;no title&rdquo;. Titles may not consist solely of numbers unless those numbers are prominently contained within the image, such as a contestant number in a race.</li>
<li><strong>Color and Monochrome of the same image</strong> - Color and Monochrome images from the same capture that share substantial pictorial content in common will be considered the same image and must be given the same title.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<!-- General T & C - General Terms and Conditions from PSA -->
<h4 class="headline text-color">PSA Statement on Subject Matter</h4>
<p><strong>PSA Statement on Subject Matter - applicable to all sections</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental rule that must be observed at all times and <strong>applies to all sections</strong> offered in exhibitions with PSA recognition is that <strong>the welfare of living creatures is more important than any photograph</strong>. This means that practices such as baiting of subjects with a living creature and removal of birds from nests, for the purpose of obtaining a photograph, are highly unethical, and such photographs are not allowed in any exhibition with PSA recognition. &nbsp;Under no circumstances may a living creature be placed in a situation where it will be killed, injured or stressed for the purpose of obtaining a photograph. Images that show live creatures being fed to captive animals, birds or reptiles are not permitted under any circumstances.<br>There are also concerns about the use of aerial photography, drones, helicopters, low flying aircraft. These should not cause any interference with other individuals or animals which causes a disturbance in their normal activity or disrupt the way any individuals or animals interact with their environment. &nbsp;<strong>Entrants in PSA recognized exhibitions should comply with all relevant laws and regulations, associated with aerial photography, in the country in which the image was taken. &nbsp;</strong><br>Entry into PSA recognized exhibitions is conditional on accepting these policies. &nbsp;The content of images must comply with the General Conditions and with the Division and Section definitions listed in these conditions. Images that - in the sole opinion of the judges or the Exhibition Organizers - do not comply, will be disqualified so the entrant may be aware of the problem when considering entry into other exhibitions with PSA recognition.</p>
