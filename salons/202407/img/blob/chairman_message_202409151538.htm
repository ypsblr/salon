<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First and foremost, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the 257 authors from 38 countries for their incredible response, submitting a total of 3,227 photos. The entire team is immensely proud of this accomplishment. I sincerely thank each contributor for sharing such magnificent and breathtaking images. Our salon has received five international recognitions from esteemed photography federations, providing participants with the opportunity to achieve their sought-after distinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">YPS enthusiastically promotes the participation of photography clubs and groups by offering discounts, and it&rsquo;s gratifying to see clubs from both India and abroad taking advantage of this opportunity. This is our 15th International Salon, following YPS&rsquo;s successful organisation of 42 National and 14 International salons in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outstanding success of this event is a result of the global participation we received. This achievement was made possible by the privilege of collaborating with a talented, dedicated, and thoughtful team. I am truly grateful for their insights and exceptional efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our in-house salon judging software, originally developed by the late Shri Murali Santhanam, has been further enhanced based on feedback from judges of previous YPS International Salons. We follow an open-judging process, enabling participants to view their scores webcast and track the progress of their photos throughout the evaluation. I am deeply grateful to our distinguished jury who are accomplished photographers in their own right and conducted the assessment with utmost integrity and impartial expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">t is a great honor to serve as the International Salon Chairman for the third consecutive time, following my earlier roles as National Salon Chairman on three occasions and International Salon Secretary twice. I sincerely thank the YPS Executive Committee for placing their trust in me to oversee the execution of this salon. This added responsibility is one I'm delighted to shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Chairman of the YPS International Digital Salon 2024, I feel deeply honored. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the photography community for their invaluable contributions, which were instrumental in making this salon a resounding success. For those of us involved in the planning and execution, this journey has been an incredible learning experience, filled with enjoyment and a strong sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My heartfelt thanks go out to our print partners, such as Technova, and all the media partners who significantly contributed to the salon&rsquo;s success. I am also deeply grateful to the dedicated YPS Executive Committee and our committed Salon Committee members, who have consistently strived for excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A special acknowledgment goes to Ms. Anitha Mysore, our Salon Secretary, for sharing the responsibilities and providing invaluable support in decision-making and execution. Lastly, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to our Salon mentor, Mr. Mohammed Arfan Asif, for his unwavering guidance throughout this journey.</p>

<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Secretary</h3>
<p>I am delighted to present another detailed report, this time on the YPS International Salon 2024. This marks the fifth consecutive Salon I have had the honor of organizing, and it has been a rewarding experience for everyone involved.</p>
<p>This year, we had the privilege of bringing together seven distinguished international jury members. Three of these experts were from YPS, and they shared their wealth of experience during the judging process. The diverse perspectives of the jury enriched the evaluation, giving the Salon a global outlook.</p>
<p>We received an outstanding and enthusiastic response from participants, with a surge of activity in the final days before the submission deadline, highlighting the prestige and recognition the YPS International Salon enjoys. The impressive number of entries reflected the trust and passion of photographers worldwide.</p>
<p>Our dedicated support team, led by our diligent Chairman, Vikas, once again showcased their professionalism. Thanks to Vikas&rsquo;s swift and efficient coordination, we stayed perfectly on track, ensuring the smooth execution of the event.</p>
<p>This year, we welcomed a new Webmaster, Gopinath Guptha, who expertly handled the backend operations. He was ably supported by Koushik. During the jury sessions, our Chairman stepped in to seamlessly manage the online platform, earning praise from the jury for his effective leadership.</p>
<p>A key role was played by our reviewers, who meticulously evaluated the 3,227 submissions. Their tireless efforts ensured that we upheld our commitment to quality and fairness. The Creatives team demonstrated outstanding initiative, working tirelessly to shape the visual identity of the Salon. Their contributions made the event engaging and unforgettable. Meanwhile, our media and publicity team did a remarkable job of promoting the event, expanding our reach and capturing the attention of photographers and art lovers alike. With the addition of two new committee members focusing on publicity, no effort was spared in generating excitement and participation.</p>
<p>The jury members were highly cooperative, adhering to the schedule and overcoming time zone differences to participate in meetings. Their insightful discussions fostered a spirit of international collaboration and enhanced the judging process. We maintained transparency by publishing the results on time, a reflection of our careful planning and execution.</p>
<p>As we now turn our attention to the upcoming physical exhibition, scheduled for next month, we anticipate it will be a fitting celebration of the talent and hard work invested in this event. It will offer photographers and enthusiasts the chance to experience the artistry of photography firsthand.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the YPS International Salon 2024 was a great success. I would like to sincerely thank the YPS Executive Committee, the Salon Committee, and our dedicated Chairman for their unwavering commitment. This event would not have been possible without their support and hard work.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to serve as Salon Secretary, and I look forward to contributing to the continued success of YPS International Salons in the future.</p>
