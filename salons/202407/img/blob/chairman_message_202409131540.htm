<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First and foremost, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the 257 authors from 38 countries for their incredible response, submitting a total of 3,227 photos. The entire team is immensely proud of this accomplishment. I sincerely thank each contributor for sharing such magnificent and breathtaking images. Our salon has received five international recognitions from esteemed photography federations, providing participants with the opportunity to achieve their sought-after distinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">YPS enthusiastically promotes the participation of photography clubs and groups by offering discounts, and it&rsquo;s gratifying to see clubs from both India and abroad taking advantage of this opportunity. This is our 15th International Salon, following YPS&rsquo;s successful organisation of 42 National and 14 International salons in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outstanding success of this event is a result of the global participation we received. This achievement was made possible by the privilege of collaborating with a talented, dedicated, and thoughtful team. I am truly grateful for their insights and exceptional efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our in-house salon judging software, originally developed by the late Shri Murali Santhanam, has been further enhanced based on feedback from judges of previous YPS International Salons. We follow an open-judging process, enabling participants to view their scores webcast and track the progress of their photos throughout the evaluation. I am deeply grateful to our distinguished jury who are accomplished photographers in their own right and conducted the assessment with utmost integrity and impartial expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">t is a great honor to serve as the International Salon Chairman for the third consecutive time, following my earlier roles as National Salon Chairman on three occasions and International Salon Secretary twice. I sincerely thank the YPS Executive Committee for placing their trust in me to oversee the execution of this salon. This added responsibility is one I'm delighted to shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Chairman of the YPS International Digital Salon 2024, I feel deeply honored. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the photography community for their invaluable contributions, which were instrumental in making this salon a resounding success. For those of us involved in the planning and execution, this journey has been an incredible learning experience, filled with enjoyment and a strong sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My heartfelt thanks go out to our print partners, such as Technova, and all the media partners who significantly contributed to the salon&rsquo;s success. I am also deeply grateful to the dedicated YPS Executive Committee and our committed Salon Committee members, who have consistently strived for excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A special acknowledgment goes to Ms. Anitha Mysore, our Salon Secretary, for sharing the responsibilities and providing invaluable support in decision-making and execution. Lastly, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to our Salon mentor, Mr. Mohammed Arfan Asif, for his unwavering guidance throughout this journey.</p>

<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Secretary</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am pleased to present yet another comprehensive report, this time on the YPS International Salon 2024. This event was the fifth consecutive Salon I have had the privilege of organizing, and it has been a satisfying experience for all involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year, we managed to put together seven esteemed international jury members. We were fortunate to avail the services of three jury members from YPS, who brought with them their vast experiences to the fore during the judging process. The diversity in the jury added an international perspective to the salon's evaluation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We received an overwhelming and positive response from participants, with the last few days before closing seeing hectic activity, underlining the reputation and prestige of the YPS International Salon. The substantial number of submissions demonstrated the trust and enthusiasm of photographers worldwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our support team, led by our dedicated Chairman, Vikas, has come to be known for their professionalism and this was demonstrated amply during this Salon too. The quicksilver work of the Chairman ensured that we were always in tune with the ticking clock,&nbsp; ensuring the event's smooth functioning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time, we inducted a new Webmaster, Gopinath Guptha, who efficiently managed the backend. During the jury meetings, it was the Chairman, standing in for the Webmaster, who deftly managed the smooth functioning of the event's online platform, eliciting accolades from the jury.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reviewers played a vital role in evaluating the 3227 pictures submitted. Their untiring work ensured that the salon maintained its high standards, adhering to our commitment to quality and impartial evaluation. The Creatives team exhibited exceptional proactivity and efficiency, working tirelessly to create an engaging and memorable experience. Their creative input crafted the visual identity of the salon. Our media and publicity team did an outstanding job in promoting the event. Their efforts generated significant interest among photographers and art enthusiasts, expanding our reach and ensuring that the YPS International Salon received the attention it deserved. With two new members inducted into the Salon committee for publicity, no stone was left unturned to get a good response.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The jury members were very cooperative, scored the pictures per schedule and made themselves available for jury meetings without much ado despite conflicting time zones. Their discussions and insights enriched the event, fostering a sense of international camaraderie and collaboration, not to mention the wealth of knowledge brought to the table, enhancing the judging process. The results were published as scheduled, further enhancing the credibility and transparency of the YPS International Salon 2024. The timely release of results was a testament to the meticulous planning and execution of the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we look forward to the upcoming physical exhibition, scheduled in a month's time, we anticipate it will be a culmination of the creative talents and hard work put into this event. The physical exhibition promises to be an opportunity for photographers and art enthusiasts to witness the beauty and artistry of photography up close.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, the YPS International Salon 2024 was a resounding success. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the YPS Executive Committee, the Salon Committee and our esteemed Chairman for their unwavering commitment and dedication. This event would not have been possible without their motivating efforts.</p>
