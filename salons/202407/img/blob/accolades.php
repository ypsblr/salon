				I am A G Gangadhar here from Bengaluru, India; It was an honour to be a jury member for the YPS International Salon 2024. As a Jury for 
				Nature Section, it was a great experience to witness and view some outstanding images received around the world. It was very nice to meet
				co-juries and Salon Organisers during the final award session. As always YPS has set a Standard of receiving a record number of entries. 
				The Salon was organised extremely well.  I would like to Congratulate Team YPS for Organising a Salon very successfully.

				When Anita mam (YPS Salon chairperson) invited me as one of the juries (Nature section) for their upcoming National Salon 2024, it was a 
				pleasant surprise for me & I felt really honored to be in the jury panel.
            <br><br>
                There would be hardly any photographer (Active) in India who does not know about YPS. The Youth Photographic Society (YPS) is one of the 
                oldest and highly acclaimed clubs in India.
            <br><br>
                Judging this salon was a really wonderful experience. The works (entries) submitted in the nature section by participants was really commendable
                & had a tough time selecting winners. I liked their professional approach in every aspect. I congratulate Anita Mam, Vikas sir, Kishan sir and the
                complete team of YPS salon for their hard work and dedication.
            <br><br>
                I am once again thankful to YPS for this opportunity & my best wishes to YPS for their upcoming projects.

				It was absolute pleasure and humbling experience for being selected as jury of prestigious YPS 2024 National salon. My association with 
				YPS goes back many years, my first salon participation is in YPS and my first award is from YPS. 
			<br><br>
				Over the years, I have always participated as participant, but to select and judge fellow photographers work is much more stressful. 
				It was indeed a big learning experience for me to go through the process, interact and learn from fellow jury members. The YPS salon 
				committee well known for its process and standards, always ensured that minute details and nuances of salon are well addressed. The YPS 
				salon software is one of the best in India and makes it so much easy to judge and also deliberate among other jury members. I thoroughly
				enjoyed the salon judging experience and thank YPS salon committee from bottom of my heart for giving this wonderful opportunity.

				This is for the first time I have been a jury member of a YPS program. Yes, it's indeed a privilege for me and an honor too.
                <br><br>
                I can still remember my first award at the travel section, 23 years ago in YPS Salon when I was a student of photography & never had 
                thought that I could be a part of a jury team at a leading club like Youth Photographic Society. The entire judging session was quite 
                unique to me. Starting from the interaction with the organising team to the google meet video session while finalising the awards -
                it looked like a festival. I had enjoyed it like all of you, and like every jury event that I had gone through , it remained a 
                learning experience for me.
                <br><br>
                I am thankful for your coordination, your punctuality and your attention to each and every minute part of the jury sessions. I acknowledge
                your assistance too. My best wishes for the program and I wish the exhibition of photographs too, will be as nice as the jury sessions.
