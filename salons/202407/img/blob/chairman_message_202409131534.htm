<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First and foremost, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the 257 authors from 38 countries for their incredible response, submitting a total of 3,227 photos. The entire team is immensely proud of this accomplishment. I sincerely thank each contributor for sharing such magnificent and breathtaking images. Our salon has received five international recognitions from esteemed photography federations, providing participants with the opportunity to achieve their sought-after distinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">YPS enthusiastically promotes the participation of photography clubs and groups by offering discounts, and it&rsquo;s gratifying to see clubs from both India and abroad taking advantage of this opportunity. This is our 15th International Salon, following YPS&rsquo;s successful organisation of 42 National and 14 International salons in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outstanding success of this event is a result of the global participation we received. This achievement was made possible by the privilege of collaborating with a talented, dedicated, and thoughtful team. I am truly grateful for their insights and exceptional efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our in-house salon judging software, originally developed by the late Shri Murali Santhanam, has been further enhanced based on feedback from judges of previous YPS International Salons. We follow an open-judging process, enabling participants to view their scores webcast and track the progress of their photos throughout the evaluation. I am deeply grateful to our distinguished jury who are accomplished photographers in their own right and conducted the assessment with utmost integrity and impartial expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">t is a great honor to serve as the International Salon Chairman for the third consecutive time, following my earlier roles as National Salon Chairman on three occasions and International Salon Secretary twice. I sincerely thank the YPS Executive Committee for placing their trust in me to oversee the execution of this salon. This added responsibility is one I'm delighted to shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Chairman of the YPS International Digital Salon 2024, I feel deeply honored. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the photography community for their invaluable contributions, which were instrumental in making this salon a resounding success. For those of us involved in the planning and execution, this journey has been an incredible learning experience, filled with enjoyment and a strong sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My heartfelt thanks go out to our print partners, such as Technova, and all the media partners who significantly contributed to the salon&rsquo;s success. I am also deeply grateful to the dedicated YPS Executive Committee and our committed Salon Committee members, who have consistently strived for excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A special acknowledgment goes to Ms. Anitha Mysore, our Salon Secretary, for sharing the responsibilities and providing invaluable support in decision-making and execution. Lastly, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to our Salon mentor, Mr. Mohammed Arfan Asif, for his unwavering guidance throughout this journey.</p>
