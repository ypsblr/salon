The terms of that permission will be mutually agreed between the entrant and PSA <strong>except in the circumstances where the entered image is found to breach the PSA Ethics Policy. In those circumstances the image may be reproduced by PSA, without the entrant&rsquo;s further permission, for educational purposes to illustrate serious exhibition rule violations. For those reproductions, the entrant&rsquo;s name will be withheld</strong>.&nbsp;<br>Entries will not be accepted from entrants who indicate that their images may not be reproduced in materials related to the exhibition.&rdquo; &nbsp; The exhibition assumes no liability of any misuse of copyright.</li>
<li><strong>Alteration and Computer Generation</strong> - Subject to Divisional restrictions (particularly Nature, Photo Travel, and Photojournalism) images may be altered, either electronically or otherwise, by the maker. Adjustments to enhance images or creatively modify images are allowed providing the underlying photograph is retained in a way that is obvious to the viewer.

<li><strong>PSA Statement on Subject Matter</strong> - There is one hard and fast rule, whose spirit must be observed at all times and applies to all sections offered in PSA recognised exhibitions.</li>
<li><strong>The welfare of the subject is more important than the photograph.</strong> - This means that practices such as baiting of subjects with a living creature and removal of birds from nests, for the purpose of obtaining a photograph, are highly unethical, and such photographs are not allowed in any PSA exhibitions. The purpose of this policy is to prevent any interference with other individuals or animals which will or may cause a disturbance in their normal activity or disrupt the way any individuals or animals interact with their environment. Entry in this exhibition requires exhibitors to agree to this and other PSA policies.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Conditions</strong> - The content of images must comply with these General Conditions and with the Division and Section definitions listed in these conditions.
