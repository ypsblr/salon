			Youth Photographic Society, Bengaluru, is 46 years young and
			has, as its members, enthusiastic youth and internationally
			acclaimed photographers. YPS boasts of having the highest
			number of international distinction holders in the country. YPS
			has held 34 All India and 8 International salons (5 under my
			chairmanship) so far.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">We are encouraged by the number of entries and quality of
			entries received from India and abroad. The Salon Committee
			members developed high quality Salon Website and Judging
			Software to make it truly end-to-end digital salon. The website
			enabled easy upload of entries and payment through multiple
			modes. The software was very well appreciated by the
			participants and the judges.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">YPS is known for open-house judging with live display of
			scores, where any entrant or photo enthusiast can come and
			witness judging. The salons organized by YPS are most
			prestigious in India, because of the top-quality judges, and
			transparent judging. The judges from various parts of the
			country and from Dubai were over whelmed by the way
			judging was organized by YPS. They were surprised that,
			despite the large number of entries, the judging could be
			completed quickly without even a minute of time wasted.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">YPS also set very high standards in several other areas of the
			Salon, like publishing of results in less than 24 hours, display of
			all accepted and award-winning pictures on the Salon website
			and personal intimation of results to all the participants
			through email within a week.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">In this context, I would like to thank all the judges, and salon
			entrants, without whose support it would not have been
			successful. My personal thanks to the main Sponsors â€“ Honey
			comb, who agreed to sponsor the exhibition and to all my
			dedicated committee members for their hard and
			knowledgeable service provided.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Kindly participate in our next International salon 2018.</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Good light to all.</p>
