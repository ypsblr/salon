			explicitly consent to such information being sent to organizations that have accorded official recognition, patronage or accreditation to this

			he or she has read these Conditions of Entry when he or she fills out the entry form.  If the entrant does not so affirm the entry will not be submitted.</p>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">All entries shall conform to the stricter of these definitions for acceptances to be validated by all the 
			International Organizations granting recognition or patronage.</p>


		<h3 class="text-info">Non-Compliance to Salon Terms and Conditions / Breach of Rules</h3>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">The following paragraphs describe the outcomes of not following the terms and conditions of the Salon
			as specified by the Patronage houses. YPS will be obliged to comply with any measures proposed by the Patronage houses.</p>

		<h4 class="headline text-color">FIAP Terms</h4>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">By the sole act of submitting his/her images or files to a salon under FIAP Patronage, the entrant accepts 
			without exception and with no objection the following terms: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>that the submitted images can be investigated by FIAP to establish if these obey to FIAP regulations and definitions even if the entrant is not a member of FIAP, </li>
			<li>that FIAP will use any means at its disposal for this undertaking, </li>
			<li>that any refusal to cooperate with FIAP or any refusal to submit the original files as captured by the camera, or failure to provide sufficient evidence, will 
				be sanctioned by FIAP, </li>
			<li>that in case of sanctions following the non-compliance with FIAP regulations, the name of the entrant will be released in any form useful to inform the 
				breaches of the rules. It is recommended to leave the EXIF data in the submitted files intact in order to ease eventual investigations. If, at any time, 
				it is determined in the reasonable discretion of the exhibition organizer or the judges before, during, or after the judging of an exhibition that an entrant 
				has submitted entries where one or more images may fail to comply with these Conditions of Entry, including the stated definitions, the exhibition organizers 
				reserve the right to delete the entry from the exhibition and void any or all acceptances or awards in connection with the exhibition. Fees may be forfeited or 
				refunded in these circumstances. The entrant acknowledges that the decision of the exhibition organizers or the judges is final.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 class="headline text-color">FIAP Notice</h4>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">In order to have legal authority on those who do not respect the rules of FIAP, this salon requires participants to 
			confirm by ticking a box next to which the following text : </p>
		<blockquote class="blockquote">
			<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">&quot;I hereby expressly agree to FIAP document 018/2017 Conditions and regulations for FIAP Patronage and FIAP document 
				017/2017 Sanctions for breaching FIAP regulations and the red list. I am particularly aware of chapter II Regulations for International photographic events under 
				FIAP patronage of FIAP document 018/2017, dealing under Section II.2 and II.3 with the FIAP participation rules, the sanctions for breaching FIAP regulations and 
				the red list.&quot;</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<h4 class="headline text-color">PSA Terms</h4>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">In order to ensure that images comply with the Conditions of Entry and definitions, the exhibition organizers may carry out 
			reasonable measures to verify that:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>the images are the original work of the entrant and</li>
			<li>the images comply with the rules and definitions as set out in these Conditions of Entry</li>
		</ol>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">These steps include, but are not limited to, questioning any entrant, requiring the submission of RAW files or other 
			digital files representing the original capture of the submitted image(s), confronting the entrant with evidence that one or more submitted images fails to comply 
			with the Conditions of Entry (also known as Entry Rules), and offering the entrant a reasonable opportunity to provide counter evidence to refute the exhibition 
			organizer&apos;s evidence by a set deadline. Such entries that are not cleared or are still questionable after the entrant has presented evidence may be considered in 
			breach of these Conditions of Entry, and declined. Such entries may be referred to PSA for further investigation of possible ethics violations.</p>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">PSA retains the right to investigate in any way all complaints/suspicions of breaches of entry conditions, impose 
			sanctions if deemed necessary, void the acceptances of any image found to violate the PSA rules, include the entrant&apos;s name on the list of sanctions provided to 
			Exhibitions, and share such investigations with FIAP. Entrants automatically agree to these terms by the act of entering the Exhibition and agree to cooperate with
			any investigation.</p>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">If another party is submitting images on the entrant’s behalf, the entrant will still be held responsible for adhering 
			to these Conditions of Entry (Entry Rules) <b>and will be subject to sanction for any violations</b> to these Conditions of Entry and PSA’s Statement of Ethics 
			that may result.</p>
		<h4 class="headline text-color">PSA Notice</h4>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">When an entrant fills in the Entry Form to submit an entry the entrant will see a feature to affirm he or she has read 
			these Conditions of Entry when he or she fills out the entry form.  If the entrant does not so affirm the entry will not be submitted.</p>
		
		<h3 class="text-info">PSA Statement on &quot;Subject Matter&quot; &amp; Policies</h3>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">There is one hard and fast rule, whose spirit must be observed at all times and applies to all sections offered in PSA 
			recognised exhibitions. </p>
		<blockquote class="blockquote">
			<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify"><b>&quot;The welfare of the subject is more important than the photograph.&quot;</b></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">This means that practices such as baiting of subjects with a living creature and removal of birds from nests, for the 
			purpose of obtaining a photograph, are highly unethical, and such photographs are not allowed in any PSA exhibitions.</p>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">There is also a PSA policy on the use of aerial photography - aircraft, helicopters and drones.  This policy can be 
			found at <a href="https://psa-photo.org/index.php?psa-policies#drone" target="_blank">https://psa-photo.org/index.php?psa-policies#drone</a>.</p>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">The purpose of this policy is to prevent any interference with other individuals or animals which will or may cause 
			a disturbance in their normal activity or disrupt the way any individuals or animals interact with their environment. Entry in this exhibition requires exhibitors 
			to agree to this and other PSA policies.</p>
		<p style="line-height:1.8; text-align:justify">The content of images must comply with these General Conditions and with the Division and Section definitions listed 
			in these conditions. Images that - in the sole opinion of the judges or the Exhibition Organizers - do not comply are likely to be disqualified so the entrant 
			may be aware of the problem when considering entry into other PSA recognized exhibitions.</p>
