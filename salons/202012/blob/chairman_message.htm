			it is indeed a great feeling of successfully completing the YPS International salon 2019. I must thank all the 
			Participants for having taken your precious time to participate and submit your excellent work. We at the 
			YPS Executive Committee and Salon committee have put in our best efforts for the success of the salon.

		<p class="text text-justified">I must congratulate all the successful Award winners, for submitting your 
			best work, and it was a feast for the eyes. This year we could see a lot of new pictures and creative ideas. 
			It is a record for YPS, that we received 4765 pictures from 375 participants spread across 35 countries.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">Year after year YPS is making great strides by attracting larger number of 
			participants from across the world. It is our commitment that we will maintain a high standards, 
			be it the salon software or the transparent judging process. In this context, I must tell you that 
			the judges had spent quality time over  all the pictures submitted and discussed on every award-winning 
			image before finalizing the awards. YPS believes in “awarding the picture” rather than the author so that
			every deserving picture wins an award. I personally thank all the eminent juries for their valuable 
			judgment and look forward to having them again in our future salons. For the first time in the 
			Indian salon’s history, the entire judging for 3 days, was telecast on live stream.
		</p>
		<p class="text text-justified">As the YPS President and Salon Chairman, I gained a lot of knowledge, 
			in running the society and make it one of the most prestigious photographic societies. It gives 
			me utmost satisfaction, When I see many photo artists rating YPS salons &quot;as one of the best in the world&quot;.

		<p class="text text-justified">I will be failing in my duty, if I don’t mention the very pride of our 
			club – winning 50 best club awards- in All India and International salons- within a span of 15 months. 
			It is indeed, a record among the Indian clubs and I must give 100% credit to our club members, 
			who participated in many national and International salons and brought laurels to our society. 
			I feel proud as a President, that in my tenure, we could create a history of this magnitude. 
			I thank and wish all my fellow photographers, all the very best in their career, and achievements.

		<p class="text text-justified">On this note, dear friends, I congratulate all the award winners again, 
			and look forward to seeing many amazing images, in the years to come.
