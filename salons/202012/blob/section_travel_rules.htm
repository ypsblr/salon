			A Photo Travel image expresses the characteristic features or culture of a land as they are found naturally.  There are no 
			geographical limitations.  Images from events or <b>activities arranged</b> specifically for photography, or of subjects directed 
			or hired for photography are not permitted. Close up pictures of people or objects must include features that provide 
			information about the location.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Techniques that add, relocate, replace or remove any element of the original image, except by cropping, are not permitted.
			The only allowable adjustments are removal of dust or digital noise, restoration of the appearance of the original scene,
			and complete conversion to greyscale monochrome. Other derivations, including infrared, are not permitted.  All images must look natural.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Grayscale images (that is without tone) may be entered in Nature and Travel sections, but toned images are not permitted under these sections.
