		<h3 class="text-color">International Flavor</h3>
		<p class="text text-justify">
			This International Salon brought true international flavor to the Salon in many ways. We received submissions from 131 authors
			from 50 international countries bringing in a variety of subjects and approaches. With 8 out of 12 juries coming from other countries,
			we experienced, for the first time, the divergent perspectives on photography from across the globe.

			In summary, YPS International Salon 2020 is nothing like any of the Salons YPS handled in the past.

		<h3 class="text-color">Internationalisation of Judging</h3>
		<p class="text text-justify">
		 	YPS has successfully handled dealing with 5 different timezones and holiday schedules and completed the judging in just 2 days.
			We also had to make improvements to our judging software to make it user friendly so that the jury can work without our constant support.
