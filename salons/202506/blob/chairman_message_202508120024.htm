<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin, I want to express my gratitude to the 279 authors hailing from 35 different countries for their overwhelming response in submitting a total of 3504 pictures. The entire team takes immense pride in this achievement. I thank each contributor for submitting such magnificent and stunning photographs. Our salon has garnered six international recognitions from prominent photography federations, offering participants the chance to earn their desired distinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">YPS actively encourages the involvement of photography clubs and groups by offering discounts, and it's heartwarming to see clubs in both India and abroad making use of this opportunity. This marks our 14th International Salon, with YPS having organized 41 National and 13 International salons in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The remarkable success of this event is attributed to the global participation we received. Such achievements were made possible due to the privilege of working with a talented, thoughtful, and diligent team. I am genuinely thankful for their insights and exceptional work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our in-house developed salon judging software by Late Shri Murali Santhanam has been refined further based on feedback from judges of previous YPS International Salons. We have an open-judging process, allowing participants to view their scores live and track their picture's progress throughout the evaluation. Our distinguished jury, all renowned photographers themselves, conducted this assessment with great integrity and impartial expertise, for which I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a profound honor for me to serve as the International Salon Chairman for the second time, having previously served as the National Salon Chairman three times and International Salon Secretary twice. I would like to extend my gratitude to the YPS Executive Committee for their trust in me to lead the execution of this salon. This added responsibility is one I'm delighted to shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my role as Chairman of the YPS International Digital Salon 2023, I feel a great sense of honor. I want to express my appreciation to the photography community for their contributions, which played a crucial role in making this salon a resounding success. For those of us who have been planning and working on this committee, the experience has been a tremendous learning opportunity filled with enjoyment, and a profound sense of accomplishment. My heartfelt thanks go to our Salon partners, print partners like Technova, and all the media partners who made significant contributions to the success of the salon. I also want to express my gratitude to our dedicated YPS Executive Committee and the loyal Salon Committee members who have consistently strived for excellence. I must acknowledge Ms. Anitha Mysore, the Salon Secretary, for sharing the responsibilities and offering invaluable support in the decision-making and execution of the salon. Last but not least, my special thanks go to our Salon mentor, Mr. Mohammed Arfan Asif, for his constant guidance throughout this journey.</p>
