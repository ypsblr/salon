<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">EXHIBITION REQUIREMENTS</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Image And Entry Requirements</strong>: This exhibition is open to anyone; however, an entry may be rejected when the exhibition chair believes the entry does not conform to exhibition rules and these ES-COE. Membership in any photographic organization is not required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;">Neither awards nor acceptances will be granted to any entrant who is on the PSA Penalties List for Ethics Violation. Entry fees are not refundable in these circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>PSA Star Ratings</strong>: To receive proper star ratings credit from PSA, entrants must provide their names and country exactly the same way in each exhibition. Aliases are not permitted. Please contact PSA in the event of a name change or relocation to another country. Using one&rsquo;s name differently in different exhibitions exposes the entrant to the risk that many of their acceptances may not be recognized in PSA Star records.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Reproduction</strong>: The entrant permits the sponsors to reproduce all or part of the entered material free of charge for publication and/or display in media related to the exhibition. This may include low resolution posting on a website. PSA may request specific permission from entrants to reproduce entered images in its educational materials. The terms of that permission will be mutually agreed upon between the entrant and PSA except in the circumstances where the entered image is found to breach the PSA Ethics Policy. In those circumstances, the image may be reproduced by PSA without the entrant&rsquo;s further permission, for educational purposes, or to illustrate serious exhibition rule violations. For those reproductions, the entrant&rsquo;s name will be withheld.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;">Entries will not be accepted from entrants who indicate that their images may not be reproduced in materials related to the exhibition. The exhibition assumes no liability of any misuse of copyright.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Re-use of accepted images</strong>: Any image that has been accepted in this exhibition, past or present, may not be entered again in the same division star ratings class in any future instances of this exhibition. It may, of course, be entered in any other PSA recognized exhibitions but must always have the same title. Re-titling in another language is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Entry</strong>: An entry consists of up to and including four (4) images entered by a single entrant into the same section. The same image can receive no more than a total of twenty (20) acceptances (per star path). Identical or similar Images shall not be allowed in the same section or different sections of the same exhibition as determined by the judges or exhibition chair. Similar images are those which are practically equivalent, as defined on this page:<a href="https://psa-services.org/pdf/Practical-Equivalence.pdf"> https://psa-services.org/pdf/Practical-Equivalence.pdf</a>&nbsp; When a group of similar images is uploaded by the entrant, all similar images in all sections will be disqualified. Be advised: while similar images may be entered in different exhibitions, these images and acceptances may be disallowed by the separate review process associated with applications for stars, diamonds and galaxies. To avoid disappointment, do not enter images that are practically equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Titles</strong>:&nbsp; Each image must have a unique title that relates to the content of the image. That unique title must be used for entry of that image into any and all PSA-recognized exhibitions. Titles must be 35 characters or fewer. No titles may be visible to the judges, and nothing in the image may identify the entrant. Titles may not include file extensions such as .jpg or .jpeg (or any other camera capture file names such as IMG_xxxx). Titles may not consist of personal identifiers possibly augmented by a number; and may not include words such as &ldquo;untitled&rdquo; or &ldquo;no title.&rdquo; Titles may not consist solely of numbers unless those numbers are prominently contained within the image, such as a contestant number in a race. When entering titles, exhibitors may use Latin1 or Latin2 character sets (ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-2) which allow diacritical marks (é, ñ, ü, ą, ę, ś, etc). While text written in non-Latin writing systems (Hanzi, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, etc) might be accepted by exhibition software, this practice is discouraged because it may yield unpredictable results in galleries, catalogs and may be rejected in Star applications.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Color and Monochrome</strong>: Color and monochrome images from the same capture that share substantial pictorial content in common will be considered the same image and must be given the same title.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">DATA PROTECTION</h4>
<p dir="ltr">By entering this exhibition, you are explicitly consenting to the personal details you have supplied, including physical addresses and email addresses being held, processed and used by the exhibition chair for purposes associated with this exhibition. You also explicitly consent to such information being sent to organizations that have accorded official recognition, patronage or accreditation to this exhibition. You acknowledge, agree and accept that by entering this exhibition your participation status, which includes your first and last name, name of the country used during registration at the exhibition, number of sections entered, and number of photos entered in those sections will be made public in a published status list, and that the results of your entry will be made public in the exhibition gallery and exhibition catalog. You also agree and accept the policy regarding non- compliance to the rules of PSA.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">SUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>PSA Image creation and ownership</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In all sections of the exhibition, images must originate as photographs made by the entrant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They may not incorporate identifiable images produced by anyone else (for example: clip art, replacement skies, or stock images). Images created in whole or in part by image creation software (frequently called &lsquo;AI&rsquo; images) are not allowed. Editing or alteration of images is permitted within the limits specified in the relevant section definitions that are available here<a href="https://psaphotoworldwide.org/page/division-definitions"> https://psaphotoworldwide.org/page/division-definitions</a>. Any person submitting or attempting to submit a totally AI generated image that does not begin with a light capture from the maker to any Photographic Society of America exhibition, social media, event, or publication, other than for editorial purposes, shall be prohibited from PSA for a period of from 3 years to Life.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>FIAP Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Pictures created by artificial intelligence are not allowed in this salon! All parts of the image have to be photographed by the author who is holding the copyright of all works submitted. Offenders will be sanctioned for life.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Statement on Subject Matter - applicable to all sections</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The fundamental rule that must be observed at all times and applies to all sections offered in exhibitions with PSA recognition is that the welfare of living creatures is more important than any photograph. This means that practices such as baiting of subjects with a living creature and removal of birds from nests, for the purpose of obtaining a photograph, are highly unethical, and such photographs are not allowed in any exhibition with PSA recognition. Under no circumstances may a living creature be placed in a situation where it will be killed or injured for the purpose of obtaining a photograph. Images that show live creatures being fed to captive animals, birds or reptiles are not permitted under any circumstances.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are also concerns about the use of aerial photography, using drones, helicopters, or low flying aircraft. These should not cause any interference with other individuals or animals which causes a disturbance in their normal activity or disrupts the way any individual or animal interacts with their environment. Entrants in PSA recognized exhibitions should comply with all relevant laws and regulations associated with aerial photography in the country in which the image was taken.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Entry into PSA recognized exhibitions is conditional on accepting the above policies. The images must comply with the division and section definitions listed on the PSA website and other conditions. Images that do not comply will be disqualified by the judges.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>PSA Color Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Image category for PID color must be a color image. A greyscale or multi-colored image modified or giving the impression of having been modified by partial toning, multi toning or by the inclusion of spot color on a monochrome image is considered a Color Image.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>PSA Monochrome Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">An image is considered to be monochrome only if it gives the impression of having no color (i.e, contains only shades of gray which can include pure black and pure white) or it gives the impression of being a grayscale image that has been toned in one color across the entire image (for example by sepia, red, gold, etc.) A grayscale or multi-colored image modified or giving the impression of having been modified by partial toning, multi-toning or by the inclusion of spot coloring does not meet the definition of monochrome and shall be classified as a color work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Monochrome images may not be entered in color sections of PPD or PID.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>FIAP Monochrome Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A black and white work fitting from the very dark grey (black) to the very clear grey (white) is a monochrome work with the various shades of grey. A black and white work toned entirely in a single colour will remain a monochrome work able to stand in the black and white category; such a work can be reproduced in black and white in the catalogue of a salon under FIAP Patronage. On the other hand, a black and white work modified by a partial toning or by the addition of one colour becomes a colour work (polychrome) to stand in the colour category; such a work requires colour reproduction in the catalogue of a salon under FIAP Patronage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pictorial Image Division Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">PID includes open or general subject photography. There are no limitations on subject matter or techniques used for image capture or post processing other than the restrictions described in the PSA Statements on Artificial Intelligence, Image Creation and Authorship, and Subject Matter, which apply to all divisions. These restrictions include prohibited image elements not authored by the entrant (for example textures, replacement skies from third party software, clipart or stock images).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open sections have unrestricted subject content and may include creative images. PID theme sections have specific definitions which assist both the judges and entrants.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>PSA/FIAP Nature Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nature photography records all branches of natural history except anthropology and archaeology. This includes all aspects of the physical world, both overwater and underwater.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nature images must convey the truth of the scene. A well-informed person should be able to identify the subject of the image and be satisfied that it has been presented honestly and that no unethical practices have been used to control the subject or capture the image. Images that directly or indirectly show any human activity threatening a living organism's life or welfare are not allowed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important part of a Nature image is the nature story it tells. High technical standards are expected and the image must look natural.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Objects created by humans, and evidence of human activity, are allowed in Nature images only when they are a necessary part of the Nature story.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&nbsp;Photographs of human-created hybrid plants, cultivated plants, feral animals, domesticated animals, human-created hybrid animals, and mounted or preserved zoological specimens are not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Photographs made where the scene is natural and the animal is unharmed in a carefully managed environment, such as Zoo, rescue centers, and ethically managed natural environment farms are permitted.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Attracting or controlling subjects through the use of food or sound for the purpose of photographing them is not allowed. Maintained situations such as provided supplemental food due to hardship caused by weather conditions or other conditions beyond the animals' control, where photography is incidental to the feeding of the animal does not fall under this provision.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Controlling live subjects by chilling, anesthetic, or any other method of restricting natural movement for a photograph is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Human-made elements shall be permitted under the following circumstances:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When they are an integral part of the nature story, such as a songbird singing atop a fence post a manmade object used as nest material, or a weather phenomenon destroying a man-made structure.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When they are a small but unavoidable part of the scene, such as an unobtrusive footprint or track in the background.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Scientific tags, collars, and bands are specifically allowed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">When photographing at a zoo, sanctuary, or rehabilitation center, it would be construed that the photographer ensured that it&rsquo;s properly accredited and conforms to best practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Attention is drawn to the PSA Statements on Artificial Intelligence and Subject Matter which apply to all sections.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Editing Guidelines</strong>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Processing or editing must be limited to making the image look as close to the original scene as possible, except that conversion to grayscale monochrome is allowed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Allowed Editing Techniques</strong>:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Architecture PIDC (Color Only)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This section includes images that are visually appealing and artistic compositions featuring the aesthetic and functional aspects of architecture, including the design, form, details, materials, and spatial relationships of various structures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A good architectural image focuses on capturing and showcasing buildings, structures, and the built environment. It often emphasizes composition, lines, shapes, patterns, light, and shadow to highlight the architectural elements and create visually striking images. It can encompass a wide range of subjects, including residential and commercial buildings, landmarks, bridges, urban landscapes, interiors, and exteriors. A strong image exhibits techniques such as Framing, perspective control, and attention to lighting conditions to capture the essence and character of a structure.</p>
