It often emphasizes composition, lines, shapes, patterns, light, and shadow to highlight the architectural elements and create visually striking images. It can encompass a wide range of subjects, including residential and commercial buildings, landmarks, bridges, urban landscapes, interiors, and exteriors. A strong image exhibits techniques such as Framing, perspective control, and attention to lighting conditions to capture the essence and character of a structure.</p>
