<p dir="ltr">Nature photography records all branches of natural history except anthropology and archaeology. This includes all aspects of the physical world, both overwater and underwater.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nature images must convey the truth of the scene. A well-informed person should be able to identify the subject of the image and be satisfied that it has been presented honestly and that no unethical practices have been used to control the subject or capture the image. Images that directly or indirectly show any human activity threatening a living organism's life or welfare are not allowed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important part of a Nature image is the nature story it tells. High technical standards are expected and the image must look natural.</p>
