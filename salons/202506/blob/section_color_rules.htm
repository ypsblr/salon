<p dir="ltr"><strong>PSA Color Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Image category for PID color must be a color image. A greyscale or multi-colored image modified or giving the impression of having been modified by partial toning, multi toning or by the inclusion of spot color on a monochrome image is considered a Color Image.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pictorial Image Division Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">PID includes open or general subject photography. There are no limitations on subject matter or techniques used for image capture or post processing other than the restrictions described in the PSA Statements on Artificial Intelligence, Image Creation and Authorship, and Subject Matter, which apply to all divisions. These restrictions include prohibited image elements not authored by the entrant (for example textures, replacement skies from third party software, clipart or stock images).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open sections have unrestricted subject content and may include creative images. PID theme sections have specific definitions which assist both the judges and entrants.</p>
