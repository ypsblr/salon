<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p>I begin with heartfelt gratitude to the 343 authors from 39 countries who contributed an astounding 4,047 photographs. This overwhelming response fills our entire team with immense pride. Thank you for sharing such magnificent and captivating work. Our salon has earned four international recognitions from leading photography federations, giving participants the opportunity to achieve their coveted distinctions.</p>
<p>YPS continues to foster active participation from photography clubs and groups through Best Club and Best Participant awards, and it is truly encouraging to see both Indian and international clubs embracing this opportunity. This marks our 16th International Salon, following 43 National and 15 International salons organized in the past.</p>
<p>The resounding success of this event is a testament to the global participation we&rsquo;ve received. I am deeply grateful to my talented, dedicated, and insightful team, whose hard work made this achievement possible.</p>
<p>Our in-house salon judging software, developed by the late Shri Murali Santhanam, has been further refined based on feedback from previous judges. With our open-judging process, participants can view their scores live and track their image&rsquo;s progress throughout the evaluation. I sincerely thank our esteemed jury of accomplished photographers in their own right for their fairness, expertise, and integrity.</p>
<p>It is a great honor to serve as International Salon Chairman for the third time, having also been National Salon Chairman thrice and International Salon Secretary twice. I thank the YPS Executive Committee for their trust in my leadership.</p>
<p>The journey of the YPS International Digital Salon 2025 has been both a joy and a valuable learning experience. My heartfelt thanks go to our Salon partners, print partners like Technova, media partners, the YPS Executive Committee, and our unwavering Salon Committee members. I also extend special gratitude to Ms. Anitha Mysore, Salon Secretary, for her steadfast support and shared responsibility in the planning and execution of this salon.</p>
