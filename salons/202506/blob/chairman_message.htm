<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p>I begin with heartfelt gratitude to the 343 authors from 39 countries who contributed an astounding 4,047 photographs. This overwhelming response fills our entire team with immense pride. Thank you for sharing such magnificent and captivating work. Our salon has earned four international recognitions from leading photography federations, giving participants the opportunity to achieve their coveted distinctions.</p>
<p>YPS continues to foster active participation from photography clubs and groups through Best Club and Best Participant awards, and it is truly encouraging to see both Indian and international clubs embracing this opportunity. This marks our 16th International Salon, following 43 National and 15 International salons organized in the past.</p>
<p>The resounding success of this event is a testament to the global participation we&rsquo;ve received. I am deeply grateful to my talented, dedicated, and insightful team, whose hard work made this achievement possible.</p>
<p>Our in-house salon judging software, developed by the late Shri Murali Santhanam, has been further refined based on feedback from previous judges. With our open-judging process, participants can view their scores live and track their image&rsquo;s progress throughout the evaluation. I sincerely thank our esteemed jury of accomplished photographers in their own right for their fairness, expertise, and integrity.</p>
<p>It is a great honor to serve as International Salon Chairman for the fourth time, having also been National Salon Chairman thrice and International Salon Secretary thrice. I thank the YPS Executive Committee for their trust in my leadership.</p>
<p>The journey of the YPS International Digital Salon 2025 has been both a joy and a valuable learning experience. My heartfelt thanks go to our Salon partners, print partners like Technova, media partners, the YPS Executive Committee, and our unwavering Salon Committee members. I also extend special gratitude to Ms. Anitha Mysore, Salon Secretary, for her steadfast support and shared responsibility in the planning and execution of this salon.</p>

<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Secretary</h3>
<p>I am pleased to present a comprehensive report on the YPS International Salon 2025. This is my fourth term as Salon Secretary, and it has been one of the most rewarding yet &mdash; with greater reach this year, resulting in an outstanding collection of pictures.</p>
<p>We did face some initial hiccups related to the sections, but in the end, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It gave us the opportunity to introduce the Architecture section for the first time in a YPS Salon &mdash; and the entries were truly a sight to behold, showcasing creativity, diversity, and technical finesse from around the world.</p>
<p>We hosted an 8-member jury panel from 5 countries, attracting 343 authors, 4047 pictures from 39 countries &mdash; the highest in over three years &mdash; with particularly strong participation from YPS members.</p>
<p>Our steadfast Chairman, Vikas, led from the front, ensuring smooth operations. Gopinath Sir and Koushik ensured timely support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four reviewers worked tirelessly to maintain our high standards in evaluating 4047 pictures. A special mention must be made of Madhu and Niladri, first-time reviewers who did an excellent job alongside our other experienced reviewers. Their dedication and eye for detail ensured the judging was thorough, fair, and consistent.</p>
<p>One new initiative this year was the inclusion of selected observers during jury meetings &mdash; a step aimed at nurturing the next generation of YPS judges and securing our future judging expertise.</p>
<p>The esteemed jury members were cooperative, disciplined with timelines, and brought diverse perspectives despite time zone challenges. Their discussions enriched the process and strengthened the credibility of our selections. The results were published on schedule, reinforcing our commitment to transparency and professionalism.</p>
<p>Our Creatives team excelled in giving the salon its visual identity, while the media and publicity team ensured widespread attention and engagement from photographers and art lovers.</p>
<p>The physical exhibition will be held in less than two months, adjusted for the festival season. We look forward to this grand finale, where the artistry and dedication of our participants can be appreciated in person.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the YPS International Salon 2025 was a resounding success. My heartfelt thanks go to the YPS Executive Committee, Salon Committee, and our Chairman for their unwavering support, and to all team members whose contributions made this event possible. I am grateful for the trust placed in me and look forward to continuing to serve YPS in future salons.</p>
