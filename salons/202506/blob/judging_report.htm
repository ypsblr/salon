</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The YPS International Salon 2025 successfully concluded its remote judging process, bringing together 8 eminent jury members from 5 countries in a seamless, well-coordinated evaluation.</p>
<p>Following the close of submissions, jurors were given secure access to the entries and independently assessed each image in accordance with Salon rules. Virtual meetings for each section were then held, accommodating multiple time zones, to collectively deliberate and decide the award-winning photographs. The jurors&rsquo; professionalism and adherence to the schedule ensured timely and transparent results.</p>
<p>The Salon Committee&rsquo;s meticulous planning, technical support, and coordination &mdash; along with the contributions of the webmaster and creative team &mdash; were key to the smooth execution of the process.</p>
<p>By continuing the remote judging model first introduced in 2023, YPS reaffirmed its adaptability and commitment to excellence in a post-COVID world, demonstrating that prestigious photography salons can thrive in virtual formats without compromising quality.</p>
<p>The winning images will soon be showcased in the YPS International Salon 2025 exhibition, celebrating diversity, creativity, and photographic excellence.</p>
