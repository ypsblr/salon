<p dir="ltr"><strong>PSA Monochrome Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">An image is considered to be monochrome only if it gives the impression of having no color (i.e, contains only shades of gray which can include pure black and pure white) or it gives the impression of being a grayscale image that has been toned in one color across the entire image (for example by sepia, red, gold, etc.) A grayscale or multi-colored image modified or giving the impression of having been modified by partial toning, multi-toning or by the inclusion of spot coloring does not meet the definition of monochrome and shall be classified as a color work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&bull; Monochrome images may not be entered in color sections of PPD or PID.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>FIAP Monochrome Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A black and white work fitting from the very dark grey (black) to the very clear grey (white) is a monochrome work with the various shades of grey. A black and white work toned entirely in a single colour will remain a monochrome work able to stand in the black and white category; such a work can be reproduced in black and white in the catalogue of a salon under FIAP Patronage. On the other hand, a black and white work modified by a partial toning or by the addition of one colour becomes a colour work (polychrome) to stand in the colour category; such a work requires colour reproduction in the catalogue of a salon under FIAP Patronage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pictorial Image Division Definition</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">PID includes open or general subject photography. There are no limitations on subject matter or techniques used for image capture or post processing other than the restrictions described in the PSA Statements on Artificial Intelligence, Image Creation and Authorship, and Subject Matter, which apply to all divisions. These restrictions include prohibited image elements not authored by the entrant (for example textures, replacement skies from third party software, clipart or stock images).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open sections have unrestricted subject content and may include creative images. PID theme sections have specific definitions which assist both the judges and entrants.</p>
