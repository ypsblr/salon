<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p class="p1">First, I would like to thank the 289 authors from 34 countries for the overwhelming response in uploading 3456 pictures. I congratulate each one for the magnificent and stunning pictures! The entire team is proud of the same. The salon enjoys international patronage from most of the major photography federations, bringing opportunity for participants to earn distinctions of their choice.</p>
<p class="p1">YPS encourages club/group participation with discounts and it is heartening to see the same being used by clubs in India and overseas. YPS has held 40 All India and 12 International salons in the past with this being the 13th International Salon.</p>
<p class="p1">We were truly encouraged by the number of entries received from across the world. This astounding success was possible only because I had the privilege of working with a talented, thoughtful and diligent team. I am grateful for their insights and superb work.</p>
<p class="p1">The in-house developed salon judging software was also fine-tuned and accentuated with some more features based on the feedback from our judges of the previous YPS International Salons.</p>
<p class="p1">Open-judging, a transparent process, where the participants not only have the opportunity of viewing their scores live but also assessing where each picture ranks/stands throughout the process. The distinguished jury, all of whom are eminent photographers themselves, conducted the evaluation of the images with great conscience and unbiased expertise to which I am deeply indebted.</p>
<p class="p1">I am extremely honoured to be the Salon Chairman and thank the YPS Executive Committee for trusting me in the execution of the salon. This definitely increases the responsibility shouldered on me which I am very happy to execute.</p>
<p class="p1">As the Chairman of the YPS International Digital Salon 2022, I feel honoured and thank the photography fraternity for contributing to the salon and making it a huge success! For us who have been planning and working in the committee, there has been a lot of learning with a tremendous amount of enjoyment and an amazing feeling of work well accomplished. I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to the Salon partners, print partners - Technova and all the media partners who immensely contributed towards the success of the salon. I thank our own YPS Executive Committee and my adherent and steadfast Salon Committee members for their commitment to excel. I would fail in my responsibility if I don&rsquo;t thank Ms. Anitha Mysore, Salon Secretary who shared all the responsibilities and has been a big support in decision making and execution of the salon. My very special thanks go to our mentors Mr. H. Satish, YPS President and Mr. Mohammed Arfan Asif for constantly being the guiding factor.</p>

<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Secretary</h3>
<p class="text-justified">We have come to the end of yet another successful International Digital Salon hosted by YPS. My sincere thanks to each and everyone who either directly or indirectly contributed to the success of this salon with special thanks to the Salon Committee and YPS Executive Committee.</p>
<p class="text-justified">rom the time I was informed about my role in this Salon till now, everything went like clockwork. The first and foremost task was getting an esteemed international jury on board. With their numerous connections with people from the world of photography, not to mention the great rapport, Shri. Asif and Shri. Satish, made this task so effortless. At YPS, we make it a point to have patronage from almost all the major patronage bodies and this task too was accomplished without any hiccups. Once the Salon was declared open for entries, the entire Salon Committee swung into action, each member executing his/her task proactively. It was like a well-oiled machinery chugging along smoothly, knowing exactly what its destination was.</p>
<p class="text-justified">My biggest pillar of support during this entire process was the Salon Chairman, Vikas, himself who was always available to provide any clarification or take over the baton for the next course of action.</p>
<p class="text-justified">Thanks to a very professional set of jury members, the online judging process went smoothly. The state-ofthe- art software created with so much passion by our own webmaster, Shri. Murali keeps improving with every feedback we get. I only wish things were so smooth in the software industry in which I work.</p>
<p class="text-justified">And finally, the preparations for the print exhibition along with the humongous task of bringing out a catalog. Thanks to Shri. Rajasimha for yet another signature catalog.</p>
<p class="text-justified">Looking forward to the next Salon. Until then, stay safe.</p>
