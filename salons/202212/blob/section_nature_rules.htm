		</h4>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Nature photography records all branches of natural history except anthropology and archaeology. This includes all
			aspects of the physical world, both animate and inanimate, that have not been made or modified by humans.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Nature images must convey the truth of the scene that was photographed. A well-informed person should be able to
			identify the subject of the image and be satisfied that it has been presented honestly and that no unethical practices
			have been used to control the subject or capture the image. Images that directly or indirectly show any human activity
			that threatens the life or welfare of a living organism are not allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			The most important part of a Nature image is the nature story it tells. High technical standards are expected and the
			image must look natural. Adding a vignette or blurring the background during processing is not allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Objects created by humans, and evidence of human activity, are allowed in Nature images only when they are a necessary
			part of the Nature story.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Photographs of human-created hybrid plants, cultivated plants, feral animals, domesticated animals, human-created hybrid
			animals and mounted or preserved zoological specimens are not allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Images taken with subjects under controlled conditions, such as zoos, are allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Controlling live subjects by chilling, anaesthetic or any other method of restricting natural movement for the purpose of
			a photograph is not allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			No modification that changes the truth of a Nature image is allowed.  Images may be cropped but no other technique that
			removes, adds or moves any part of the image is allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Techniques that remove elements added by the camera, such as dust spots, digital noise and lens flare are allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Complete conversion of colour images to greyscale monochrome is allowed. Partial conversion, toning and infrared captures
			or conversions are not allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			Images of the same subject that are combined in-camera or with software by focus stacking or exposure blending are allowed.
			Multiple images with overlapping fields of view that are taken consecutively and combined in-camera or with software
			(image stitching) are allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="text-muted text-justify">
			For the purpose of this exhibition any border added to a Nature digital file must be a single border of white or grey,
			no greater than 3 -5 pixels in width.
