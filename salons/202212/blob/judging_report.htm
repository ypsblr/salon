<p style="text-align: justify;">For International Salons Youth Photographic Society follows a two step judging process in which the first step is independent scoring of images followed by selection of pictures for awards through joint consensus meeting. This promotes sharing of views among the jury and help them identify the right pictures for the awards. And this is where the members of the jury were very accommodative in accepting the timings requested by us. YPS appreciates the gesture and the informative discussions they had among themselves in making the right choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The YPS Judging system provides the jury members complete freedom and control to balance the scores through review and revisions. The jury members were very appreciative of the judging process, of the judging software and of the sincere approach by the Salon Committee in conducting a great salon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following our tradition, YPS displayed individual scores of all the pictures in four open webcast sessions on December 10th and 11th. The first webcast was opened by Mr. Satish Hanumantharao, President of YPS. Winners of each section was announced during the beginning of webcast for the next section. The last webcast ended with a note of thanks by Mr. Manju Vikas Sastry V, the Salon Chairman. The recordings of the webcasts will continue to be available on <a title="YPS International Salon 2022 - Webcasts" href="https://www.youtube.com/@YPSBengaluru/streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YPS YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the jury, people who watched the webcasts, YPS Executive Committee members, Salon Committee members, Salon Mentors and the volunteers who helped during the judging.</p>
