<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Chairman</h3>
<p class="text text-justified" style="text-align: justify;">I would like to personally thank everyone who has participated in the [contest-name].</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Another Milestone at YPS:</strong> First and foremost a <strong>big thanks </strong>to all the participants for their enthusiasm in participating in salons organised by YPS!&nbsp; Your enthusiasm and eagerness keeps us motivated to improve and excel in our organisational skills.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&rsquo;s how the tagline, <em><strong>Women At Wheel - WAW</strong></em> came into being for <em><strong>YPS National Salon 2023</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">From its inception, YPS has a tradition of men and women photographers walking shoulder to shoulder.&nbsp; This year, in the club&rsquo;s history of 52 years, the executive committee took the first step of having an all women team for the YPS National Salon 2023. Anitha Mysore and I were entrusted with the task of heading the salon.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Journey started with coining the tagline: Women At Wheel - WAW and identifying an all women team and a unique women jury for every section. We have had a joyous journey with<em> Ms Hema Naranayan, Ms Mousumi Phukan, Ms Snigdha Kar</em> at the <strong>Wheel of Color</strong>. <em>Ms Anita Basak, Ms Neetu Katyal, Ms Sona Beniwal </em>at the <strong>Wheel of Monochrome.</strong> <em>Ms Darshan Ganapathy, Ms Sharmali Das, Dr. Suwarna R Gawde </em>the <strong>Wheel of Nature.</strong> <em>Ms Happy Mukherjee, Ms Sharifa Khatri, Ms Sunita Aich</em> at the <strong>Wheel of Travel.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Behind the scene is an extremely efficient, dedicated and dynamic team of Women At Wheel:&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Salon Secretary:</strong> Ms Anitha Mysore, <strong>Webmaster:</strong> Ms Smita Goyal, <strong>Creatives: </strong>Ms Nikhita Kulkarni, <strong>Social Media: </strong>Ms Swati Shah, <strong>Sponsorships: </strong>Ms Krupa Sastry, <strong>Catalog:</strong> Ms Meera Simha, <strong>Reviewers:</strong> Ms Bhagya D, Ms Smita Goyal, Ms Neelima Reddy, Ms Vinaya Mathews.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We went a step further when Ms Deep J Contractor, I.F.S. Deputy Conservator of Forests and Director BRT Tiger Reserve consented to be the <strong>Chief Guest</strong> at the exhibition and award ceremony on 16th July at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">With Anitha as Secretary offering excellent support, I, as the <strong>Salon Chairperson &amp; Treasurer,</strong> could not ask for more!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I express my gratitude to the Executive Committee for entrusting me with the role of a chairperson.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The success of this salon will be incomplete if I fail to mention the support we received from Mr Murali Santhanam, the brain behind our state-of-the-art salon software and support at every step of the way, from our President, Mr Manju Vikas Sastry!</p>

<h3 class="text-color">Message from the Salon Secretary</h3>
<p class="text-justified" style="text-align: justify;">We are close to the end of an amazing journey&mdash;the YPS National Salon 2023, steered by an all-women team. Can you believe it? From the jury to the committee members, including our newbie woman webmaster and catalog designer, it was an extraordinary display of women power. Let me take you through the highlights of this remarkable salon.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The idea of hosting an all-women salon was born from a single thought, and boy, have we come a long way since then. While participation was open to all, we were firm on having an all-women steering committee. And guess what? The new EC fully supported our vision. It was a no-brainer that Prema and I would take the reins as Chairperson and Secretary. Together, we faced our first challenge&mdash;choosing the perfect tagline. After some brainstorming, we struck gold with "WAW - Women At Wheel."</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Finding twelve unique women jury members was no walk in the park. We wanted each section to have jury members from different locations, considering the online judging process. It was a meticulous task, but in the end, we managed to assemble an incredible panel. And that's not all! We found responsible and talented women for every role imaginable&mdash;reviewers, creatives, media managers, sponsorships, and more. Even the printing job has been entrusted to two capable women. We even have the privilege of having a woman as our chief guest. The support keeps pouring in as more women join hands for the exhibition.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Every aspect of the salon has fallen into place like clockwork. But let's not forget the men behind the scenes. They have made it count whenever needed. Our YPS President has been an unwavering source of support. Seriously, does the guy ever sleep?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We also owe a special mention to our new woman webmaster who has been instrumental in making things run smoothly. And let us not forget our Salon Chairperson&mdash;who knew one person could wear so many hats? She even took on the role of Treasurer midway through the salon. Talk about a multitasking superstar! The esteemed jury has done a fantastic job, being very approachable and accommodating.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Our reviewers have done an exceptional job, and the creatives, media, and sponsor teams have collaborated seamlessly, ensuring everything happens right on schedule. As I pen this report, we eagerly anticipate the catalog production and the upcoming exhibition. Looking back, we realize we missed the opportunity for a "Best Woman Entrant" award due to some challenges. But fear not, we will make it a priority for future salons.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, the YPS National Salon 2023 has been a testament to the incredible achievements of an all-women team. We applaud the dedication and hard work of the committee members, jury, reviewers, creatives, media teams, sponsors, and everyone involved. A special thanks to our YPS President for his tireless energy. And let's not forget the salon software, which has been on its best behavior thanks to Murali Sir's expertise.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Long live YPS! Here's to more successful all-women salons in the future. Let's raise a toast to our exceptional team!</p>
