			YPS All India Digital Salon 2019 concluded in grand style with a two-day exhibition (December 21 &amp; 22) in the City's art destination, the Chitrakala Parishath.
			We are very happy to state that we received the full resolution files of "All the 48 Winning Pictures" so that we could display them all in print. The
			pictures were printed in Technova Novajet Inkjet Media 230 GSM Matte Paper and framed to enhance their beauty and appeal. Each picture carried its own title card 
			containing names of the author, picture title and award details. All the Accepted images were also on digital display with a permanently running slideshow.

		<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
			The exhibition went live at 11 AM on December 21st and remained open till 6:30 PM on both the days. The Award Function was held on December 22nd, Sunday
			with noted Kannada Cine Actor Mr. Ramesh Bhat as the Chief Guest. The Award function included Salon Report, Distribution of Awards, Honoring of Sponsors
			and a special event to launch the Library of YPS Salon Catalogs. The Salon website now houses all the Catalogues of all YPS Salons since its first Salon
			held in 1977. These Catalogues carry rich history and acknowledges the contribution of all the previous Committee Members, Jury and volunteers
